 * - receiveMessage: Implementation of Shiny.InputBinding to use in place of
 *   the default. Typically overridden as an optimization to perform
 *   incremental value updates.
 * - type: `false`, a string, or a function.
 *     - `false` (the default): denotes that the value produced by this input
 *       should not be intercepted by any handlers registered in R on the
 *       server using shiny::registerInputHandler().
 *     - string: denotes the input's *type* and should correspond to the

 *     - function: A function called with `this` bound to the InputBinding
 *       instance and passed a single argument, the input's containing DOM

 *     A rate policy object has two members:
 *     - `policy`: Valid values are the strings "direct", "debounce", and

 *     - `delay`: Number indicating the number of milliseconds that should be
 *       used when debouncing or throttling. Has no effect if the policy is
 *       direct.
 *     The specified rate policy is only applied when `true` is passed as the
 *     second argument to the `setValue` function passed as a prop to the
 *     input component.

  / https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#breaking-change-document-ready-handlers-are-now-asynchronous
  /
  / Since Shiny uses $() to schedule initShiny, shiny>=1.4 calls initShiny

  / called renderValue() earlier than (advanced) widget authors might be expecting.

  / For a concrete example, leaflet has some methods (e.g., updateBounds)
  / which reference Shiny methods registered in initShiny (e.g., setInputValue).
  / Since leaflet is privy to this life-cycle, it knows to use setTimeout() to
  / delay execution of those methods (until Shiny methods are ready)
  / https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/blob/18ec981/javascript/src/index.js#L266-L268

in coastal tropical and warm temperate waters, occasionally offshore.  Sometimes found in small groups (Ref. 5578).  Feed on bottom-living crustaceans and mollusks.  Ovoviviparous (Ref. 50449), aplacental (Ref. 57025).  Prized angling fish, often released (Ref. 5578).  Flesh highly esteemed (Ref. 3965).","Occurs in coastal waters over continental shelves, sometimes close inshore in shallow waters, and on the high seas far from land (Ref. 247, 43278, 58302).  Oceanic, pelagic and near bottom at 1->500 m (Ref. 58302).  Depth range to at least 500 m (Ref. 247).  Feeds on pelagic fishes (lancetfishes, herring, mackerel and small billfishes (Ref. 43278)) and bottom fishes (hake (Ref. 43278)) and squids (Ref. 247).  Ovoviviparous, embryos feeding on yolk sac and other ova produced by the mother (Ref. 43278, 50449).  Stuns its prey with its long caudal fin (Ref. 247).  Utilized for human consumption, liver oil for vitamins, skin for leather, and fins for shark-fin soup (Ref. 247).  Marketed fresh and may be broiled, baked or grilled, but unsuitable for steaming, boiling or frying; meat may be salted and dried (Ref. 9987).  Also Ref. 33743.","Coastal over continental and insular shelves and epipelagic far from land (Ref. 30573, 43278, 58302).  Oceanic although most abundant near land, pelagic at 1-366 m (Ref. 58302).  Young often close inshore and in shallow bays (Ref. 5578).  Feeds on schooling fishes (including mackerels, bluefishes, clupeids, needlefishes, lancetfishes and lanternfishes), squid, octopi, pelagic crustaceans, and rarely seabirds (Ref. 247).  Ovoviviparous, embryos feeding on yolk sac and other ova produced by the mother (Ref. 43278, 50449).  Uses its long caudal fin to bunch up and stun prey (Ref. 2850).  Spatial and depth segregation by sex in northwestern Indian Ocean populations (Ref. 247).  A few attacks on boats are doubtfully attributed to this species, but it is otherwise apparently harmless to humans, though the size of adults of this species command respect (Ref. 247).  May cause damage to fishing gear (Ref. 6885).  Valued for its meat, liver, hide, and fins; utilized fresh, dried-salted, smoked, and frozen (Ref. 9987).","Eurybathic, eurythermic (Ref. 4426) and benthic (Ref. 58426). Cold temperate species found in offshore waters (Ref. 88171) on all kinds of bottoms (Ref. 3167), mainly sandy and muddy (Ref. 82311). In the northeast Atlantic most common between 50-100 m depth (Ref. 88187) at temperatures of 2-5 Â°C (Ref. 89120). Some seasonal migrations have been reported from the western Atlantic (Ref. 52109, 89121). Migration experiments showed that 85 % of tagged individuals remained within 93 km of the release site, with longest distance travelled at 180 km (Ref. 82319). Feed mainly on fish, crustaceans (Ref. 5951) and polychaete worms (Ref. 5578), but also on hydroids, molluscs, cephalopods and echinoderms (Ref. 49751); known to be a scavenger (Ref. 89122). Diet changes with increasing body size (Ref. 82311). Different populations of starry rays mature at different ages and sizes (Ref. 88171). Oviparous (Ref. 3167). Maturity size varies from 44-90 cm TL. Young hatch at ca. 8-12 cm TL (Ref. 114953). Young may tend to follow large objects, such as their mother (Ref. 205). Rarely reaches 60 cm in the North Sea (Ref. 88187). Able to detect weak electric fields generated by potential prey organisms and may also generate its own weak electric fields (Ref. 10311). Probably taken by hake trawlers (Ref. 5578). Few are dried and salted in Iceland (Ref. 6902). It has been mentioned that North American specimens grow to a larger size than East-Atlantic specimens (Arve Lynghammar, pers.comm., 11/09).","Oviparous (Ref. 50449).","Found generally at depths of more than 1000 meters (Ref. 56212).","A very rare species found on lower parts of continental slope and on adjacent deep-sea plains (Ref. 3167).  Oviparous (Ref. 50449).  Eggs have horn-like projections on the shell (Ref. 205).","Found in deepwater on lower parts of continental slopes, on submarine rises and on deep-sea plains adjacent to both (Ref. 3167).  Feeds mainly on fishes, with a small amount of shrimps (Ref. 3167).  Oviparous (Ref. 50449).  Eggs have horn-like projections on the shell (Ref. 205).  Minimum depth reported taken from Ref. 3167.","<i>Dasyatis centroura<\/i> is a coastal species (Ref. 81259), found over sandy and muddy bottoms (Ref. 3169). It feeds on bottom-living invertebrates and fishes (Ref. 3169). Ovoviviparous (Ref. 6901). Wings marketed fresh, smoked, dried-salted; used for fishmeal and oil. Harmful to shellfish banks; dangerous to bathers and fishers due to its poisonous spine. May attain well over 100 cm TL. Warm season visitor to coastal waters (Ref. 6902).","A coastal and offshore shark (Ref. 9997) found along continental margins in most tropical and temperate seas.

Gestation period lasts 15-18 months, spawning cycle is every 3 years.  Some authors (Refs. 1661, 28081, 31395) have erroneously assumed that two age rings are deposited per year by this species, thus underestimating longevity, age at maturity, and resilience . These data have been removed and replaced by recent, verified estimates (Refs. 86586, 86587, 86588).  Tagging in New Zealand indicates seasonal migrations (Ref. 26346).  The presence of genetic differentiation in mitochondrial DNA across global populations (Ref. 36416) suggests dispersal may be male-biased, and that females may have natal site-fidelity.  Shortfin mako has been shown to have a marked sexually segregated population structure (Ref. 86954).  Shortfin mako is probably the fastest of all sharks and can leap out of the water when hooked (Ref. 6871).

Their latitudinal (north-south) and depth-related (nearshore-offshore) movements appear to be correlated with their preferred temperature (Ref. 247). Tagging experiments showed that populations in the northern North Sea and northwest Scotland made winter migrations to off Norway and summer migrations to Scotland (Ref. 88880, 88881). Transoceanic migrations recorded, but rare (Ref. 88864). Longevity in the northern Atlantic is about 35-50 years (Ref. 88882), but most live only 20-24 years (Ref. 88187). Growth is slow.

Distinct pairing with embrace (Ref. 205). Sexual dimorphism is evident in the thicker skin layer of maturing and adult females (Ref. 49562). This thickened skin may serve as protection from the 'bites' the female species receive from the males during precopulation and in the rugged conditions of the rock and coral environment where they live (Ref. 49562).

The males did not become interested in the female until she slowed, moved to the sand area and started cupping her pelvic fins. The two males then became competitive toward each other, circling and tailing, until the alpha male forced the beta male out of the sand area. The female bit the male prior to copulation. She exhibited shielding behavior for several days and then resumed cupping and flaring. The female gradually changed her swimming position and began displaying the submissive behavior. The alpha male swam in increasingly larger circles and began splaying its claspers, then approached the female and exhibited tailing and nosing. Copulation occurred as the male bit into the right flank and trailing edge of the pectoral fin of the female. The male swam side by side with the female, copulating with the right clasper for one to two minutes. After copulation, the male showed little interest in the female.\" In captivity, males show aggression toward other species after copulation (Ref. 51113, 49562). Females avoid patrolling males by 'shielding' with pelvics close to the substrate (Ref. 51113, 49562). However, female acceptance of future male partner is indicated by a show of 'submissive' body, 'cupping' and 'flaring' of pelvic fins (Ref. 51113, 49562).","Exhibit ovoviparity (aplacental viviparity), with embryos feeding on other ova produced by the mother (oophagy) after the yolk sac is absorbed (Ref. 50449).

In the southern waters of Australia, newly born and older juveniles (30-70 cm long) aggregate in 'nursery areas' found in shallow waters.They move to deeper coastal waters to over-winter. The following spring finds most of these young returning to their nursery areas. The older ones, aged 2 years and over move instead to eastern Bass Strait where most of the immature stock are found. The length of an average full-term embryo is 32 cm. Spawning frequency is once every year, ovulation occurring in early summer and parturition is completed by January of the following year.

Development of young in the uterus being sustained by a large supply of yolk. Females give birth in late spring and summer in waters off Florida. During courtship, a pair sometimes a triplet of adults engaged in synchronized parallel swimming. While on it, the male may grab one of the female's pectoral fins with his mouth which induces the female to pivot 90Â° and roll on her back on the bottom. Then the male inserts a clasper in her vent, and then roll on his back beside the female. Pair may break apart and depart rapidly after copulation or the male may remain motionless on the subtrate as if recovering from the mating bout (Ref. 49562). Not all attempts of males to copulate with a female nurse shark result in successful fertilization, females may employ avoidance by 'pivotting and rolling' to escape from male attention (Ref. 49562). Or females may 'lie on back' and rest motionless and rigidly on the substrate (Ref. 51113, 49562). On the contrary, females send signals of readiness to copulate with males by arching their body toward their male partner and cupping the pelvic fin (Ref. 51126, 49562).

The species is a bycatch of industrial and artisanal trawl and net fisheries, as well as recreational fisheries in South Africa, and is retained for human consumption or discarded. It is suspected to have limited biological productivity similar to other myliobatid rays (including a low fecundity of 3â6 pups per litter), limiting its capacity to sustain fishing pressure. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species.It has largely not been documented from trawl surveys in the Mediterranean Sea and very few records are available from its remaining range across the Eastern Central Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic, and Western Indian Ocean despite ongoing artisanal fisheries monitoring projects. In fact, although reports indicate that it was historically common in many locations across West Africa, contemporary patterns of landings indicate that, except for Mauritanian waters, there have been limited records of this species in the past decade from across the Eastern Central Atlantic region.Overall, considering these declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in trawl surveys and fisheries in several localities where is previouslyÂ occurred, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its limited productivity, and noted declines inÂ eagle rays in general in several parts of its range, it is suspected that the Duckbill Eagle Ray has undergone a population reduction of >80% over the past threeÂ generation lengths (51 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The Bigeye Thresher (Alopias superciliosus) is a large (to 484 cm total length) pelagic shark, occurring worldwide in tropical and temperate seas from the surface down to depths of 955 m. It has a low fecundity (average two pups per litter)  and the lowest intrinsic rebound potential of the thresher shark species. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in  pelagic and coastal commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet  fisheries. Although intrinsically more sensitive to over-exploitation, the Bigeye Thresher is generally deeper and less catchable than its tropical congener the Pelagic Thresher (A. pelagicus). The Bigeye Thresher is often retained for the meat and fins unless domestic or international regulations prohibit retention. However, high at-vessel mortality remains a threat where retention is prohibited. The species is estimated to be  declining in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and increasing in a large area around Hawaii with the trends uncertain in the wider Pacific. Globally, the population is estimated to have reduced by 30â49% over the last three generations (55.5 years), based on abundance data and current levels of exploitation. The Bigeye Thresher is therefore assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Common Thresher (Alopias vulpinus) is a large (to 573 cm total length), circumglobal, coastal and pelagic shark that occurs from the surface down to depths of 650 m. It is long-lived (38 years), yet with larger litters (2â6 pups) and possibly an annual reproductive cycle, it consequently has a higher rate of population increase (0.254) than the Pelagic Thresher (A. pelagicus) and the Bigeye Thresher (A. superciliosus). The species is caught as target and bycatch in pelagic and coastal commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. The species is often retained for the meat and fins unless domestic or international regulations prohibit retention. However, high post-release mortality remains a threat where retention is prohibited. The species is estimated to be declining in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea and increasing in the Eastern Pacific, following regulations implemented in the mid 1980s. Based on levels of exploitation and the estimated global population reduction of 30â49% over the last three generations (76.5 years), globally,Â the Common Thresher is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Thorny Skate (Amblyraja radiata) is a medium-sized (to 111 cm total length) skate occurring in the North Atlantic fromÂ South Carolina (USA) to Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, United Kingdom, Norway, and to Russia. It is demersal on continental and insular shelves and slopes from nearshore to 1,400 m depths, usually at 25â440 m. This skate is genetically indistinguishable throughout its range, yet it exhibits marked life history differences on either side of the Atlantic and in different parts of the Northwest Atlantic, growing more slowly, maturing later and reaching a larger maximum size in the southern extent of their Northwest Atlantic distribution.Â The generation length is 16 years in the Northwest Atlantic (south) and 10.6 years elsewhere. It was subject to intensive target fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic and taken as bycatch in mainly trawl, but also longline and gillnet, fisheries in the USA and Canadian waters south of the Laurentian Channel (Georges Bank and Scotian Shelf). In the USA, commercial retention of Thorny Skate was banned 2003, but it is still taken as bycatch and discarded from trawl fisheries. In Canada on the Scotian Shelf, target fisheries ended in 2002 and any bycatch is now discarded. In the Northeast Atlantic, this skate has limited value and it is generally discarded and has a low discard mortality. Population trends and management vary widely, resulting in different status and trends throughout its range. On both sides of the Atlantic, the southern-most populations of this boreal species have shifted northward in response to climate-change induced habitat shifting and alteration, which, in combination with earlier intensive fishing, resulted in very steep declines (>80% reduction in three generations) in the most southerly parts of its distribution. At more northerly latitudes, earlier levels of exploitation have ceased or greatly decreased resulting in recovery and increasing abundance. Overall, Thorny skate has undergone an estimated population reduction of 30â49% over the last three generation lengths (32â48 years) due the combination of exploitation with habitat shifting and alteration due to climate change at lower latitudes while, further north, earlier levels of exploitation that have ceased or greatly decreased and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.Â ","White Ghost Catshark (Apristurus aphyodes) is a deepwater catshark known only from a limited number of specimens taken from upper to mid continental and insular slopes in the Northeast Atlantic at depths of 1,014â1,800 m. Most of this speciesâ range is outside the reach of deepwater fisheries. Its limited interaction with deepwater fisheries suggests that overexploitation risk is low; therefore it is assessed as Least Concern in European waters.","The Fleshynose Catshark (Apristurus melanoasper) has a widespread but patchy distribution in the Northeast Atlantic, Northwest Atlantic and Southwest Pacific.

It is an uncommon bycatch of commercial deepwater trawlers, and the majority of its habitat is outside the reach of fisheries. Given the little overlap between the speciesâ range and deepwater fisheries, it can be inferred that the risk of fisheries exploitation affecting the population is low, therefore the species is assessed as Least Concern globally.","The Pallid Skate (Bathyraja pallida) is a large (to at least 162 cm total length) deep-water skate known from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to northern Bay of Biscay and Rockall Trough in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. It has been recorded from the lower continental and insular slopes to the abyss at depths of 1,869â3,366 m. There are no known deep-water industrial fisheries currently in the region that reach the depth of the species. The species is not suspected to be close to reaching the population reduction threshold. There is nothing to suspect or infer population reduction at this time and the Pallid Skate is therefore assessed as Least Concern.","Richardsonâs Skate (Bathyraja richardsoni) is a bathydemersal species that occurs on the continental slope, submarine rises, and deepwater plains at depths of 1,219â2,992 m. It is known from sporadic records across its global distribution, which indicates that it is widespread. Its deep bathydemersal range places it beyond the current range of most human threats, in particular deepwater fisheries. Given that this species is widespread, rarely caught in fisheries (which have also decreased effort in recent years), and occurs at depths beyond the reach of the main deepwater fisheries operating in its range, Richardsonâs Skate is assessed as Least Concern. In the future, bycatch in deepwater fisheries should be monitored and managed, particularly if deepwater fisheries expand into its range.","The Roughtail Stingray (Bathytoshia centroura) is a large (to 220 cm disc width) demersal stingray that occurs in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic from Cape Cod and the  Georges Bank, Massachusetts, USA to the Bahamas and the Texas Gulf  Coast, and in the Southwest Atlantic from Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil to  Golfo San MatÃ­as, Chubut, Argentina and inhabits soft bottoms, usually to 100 m depth but occasionally to 275 m. They are captured by demersal trawls, gillnets, and hooks and lines. While there are no population data for this species, due to its similar habitat use and biology to Southern Stingray, it is suspected that any reduction in population size has not approached thresholds. In the southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense across, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline  fisheries in many areas. This large inshore stingray is likely to have a late maturity  and slow life history, making it particularly susceptible to fisheries;  it has no geographic or bathymetric refuge from fishing. Due  to the level of  exploitation by    widespread  artisanal and  commercial fisheries   which lack adequate  management, it  is suspected   that this species has undergone a population    reduction  of >80%   over the past three generation lengths (64.5 years)   in the  Atlantic   South American part of its range. Overall, due to suspected stability in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic, combined with the suspected >80% reduction in the Southwest Atlantic, it is suspected that globally this stingray has undergone a population reduction of 30â49% over the past three generations. Therefore, the Roughtail Stingray is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd. ","The Copper Shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus) is a large (to 325 cm total length) shark that has a circumglobal but patchy distribution in warm temperate and subtropical waters from close inshore to depths of 145 m. It also occurs in brackish or freshwater in the lower reaches of rivers and in bays and has inshore nursery grounds. The species is taken as target and bycatch of industrial, small-scale, and recreational fisheries with mainly longline and gillnet gear. It has a low biological productivity that would lower its resilience to fishing pressure. The Copper Shark appears to represent only a  small part of the reported shark catches in most regions and may have a  naturally low abundance across most of its range. Population trend data was available from South Africa for 26 years (1978â2003) and from South Australia for 17 years (2002â2018). In South Africa,  the population was estimated to have increased over the past three generation  lengths to 2003 (71 years) in the bather protection program, yet from 2003 to 2018, the CPUE steadily declined. In South Australia, the population was estimated to have undergone a reduction of  62.6% over three generation lengths (71 years). Elsewhere in Australia the population was considered stable, except for a potential decline in the New South Wales shark meshing program. The Copper Shark  population has potentially increased in the Gulf of California, is potentially increasing or stable in New Zealand, and has potentially  declined in the Southwest Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and  Peru. Except for the Northwest Pacific, where there has likely been an  actual inferred decline in population abundance of 55â99% over the past three generation lengths (71 years), there is little concurrent  effort data for this species in those regions and thus the population  trend cannot be definitively determined; the changes may be due to  environmental factors and changes in fishing practices. There is a high level of uncertainty with the estimated population trends, and over most of its range the Copper Shark appears to be declining. With a precautionary approach, it is suspected that the Copper Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30â49% over the past  three generation lengths (71 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Spinner Shark (Carcharhinus brevipinna) is a large (to 304 cm total length) shark that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and Indo-West Pacific Oceans. It is coastal and pelagic in warm temperate and tropical waters on continental shelves at depths of 0â200 m. The low biological productivity combined with its schooling behaviour and tendency to occur in inshore waters make it susceptible to fishing pressure, although if the pressure is on the juveniles only, it can be sustainable.  The species is taken as target and bycatch of industrial, small-scale, and  recreational fisheries using a range of gears, including trawl,  longline, and gillnets. Over the past three generation lengths (38 years), the population is estimated to have increased in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic in response to management measures and to have undergone a minor reduction of 3% in South Africa. It is suspected to have declined by >30% in the Arabian Seas region over the past three generation lengths (38 years) and is inferred to have also declined in the Mexican Atlantic, Southwest Indian Ocean, West Africa, and Southeast Asia. In Australia, it is captured in low numbers in managed fisheries and likely to be sustainably fished. The Spinner Shark has low biological productivity and although there is  less fishing pressure and managed fisheries in some parts of its range, most of its range occurs in areas of intensive and unregulated  fisheries. It is suspected  that the Spinner Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30â49%  over the past three generation lengths (38â59 years) due to  exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Blacktip Shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) is a medium-sized (to 286 cm total length) shark with a circumglobal distribution in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate seas. It is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf from inshore to a depth of 140 m, though mostly it occurs close inshore. It also often occurs in large schools near the surface, and it has inshore nursery grounds. The species is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries and is retained for the high value meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The Blacktip Shark is estimated to be sustainably fished in areas where management measures are in place, i.e., the United States Gulf of Mexico, North Atlantic, Australia, and South Africa. Species-specific population trend data from these regions reveal population reductions of <20% over the past three generation lengths in the Gulf of Mexico and South Africa (27â45 years). The North Atlantic population reduction in the spawning stock fecundity was not to a level where the stock was overfished, while in Australia, stock assessments on the Blacktip Shark complex indicate stocks have recovered from previous overfishing and are now sustainable. In the Arabian Seas region, a population decline of 30â49% is suspected for the Blacktip Shark. Elsewhere, little data is available, but the species is exposed to intensive and unmanaged fishing effort and due to its preference for inshore habitats, has limited refuge from fishing pressure. There is evidence of declines in general shark catches in many parts of its range where there is a lack of management, despite ongoing high levels of effort; declines in whaler sharks across the regions Large Marine Ecosystems equate to a 54% reduction in the Blacktip Shark over the average past three generation lengths (38 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific and is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Overall, it is suspected that the Blacktip Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30â49% over the past three generation lengths (27â49 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Dusky Shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) is a large (to 420 cm total length) coastal and pelagic shark with a patchy distribution in tropical and warm temperate seas from the surface down to depths of 500 m. The species has low biological productivity with late age-at-maturity and a long reproductive cycle. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic and coastal large- and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries and is often retained for the meat and fins. Steep declines have occurred in the Northwest Atlantic and Eastern IndianÂ Ocean, and to a lesser degree, in the Western IndianÂ Ocean; trends in the Eastern Atlantic off West Africa are suspected to be declining. The global population reduction is estimated to have undergone a reduction of 71.8%, with the highest   probability of >80% reduction over three generation lengths (89.4â114   years). The areas with available abundance trend data are relatively small    compared to the global distribution, and abundance trends are unknown in parts of its distribution. The overall estimated population reduction is steep and management in many parts of its range is lacking, including areas of intense exploitation, likely  leading to steep inferred population reduction. However, management  action in the Northwest Atlantic and Eastern Indian Ocean have resulted in the stabilization and possible slow recovery in these regions  Therefore, the Dusky Shark is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The Sandbar Shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) is a medium-sized (to at least 240 cm total length) shark with a circumglobal distribution in tropical and temperate seas. It is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf from close inshore to a depth of 280 m. The species is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries and is retained for the high value meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. Species-specific population trend data reveal population reductions of >50% and >80% in the United States and South Africa, respectively over the past three generation lengths (60â78 years), and stock assessments in Australia indicate a reduction of 60% over the past three generation lengths (78 years). It is also suspected to have declined by 50â79% in the Mediterranean and the Arabian Seas region over the past three generation lengths (60â78 years). All of these declines are attributed to fisheries exploitation. There are signs of population recovery in areas where management measures are in place, such as the United States, South Africa, and Australia. In the Southwest Atlantic and West Africa, where species-specific information is lacking, there are high levels of unmanaged fisheries exploitation, and it is suspected that the Sandbar Shark has also declined in those areas. Overall, it is suspected that the Sandbar Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50â79% over the past three generations lengths (60â78 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The Sand Tiger Shark (Carcharias taurus) is a large (to 325 cm total length) shark with a circumglobal distribution. It is demersal and pelagic in tropical and temperate seas on the continental shelf at depths of 0â232 m, however it mainly occurs in shallow waters of 15â25 m depth. It has very low biological productivity, with litter sizes of just 2 pups, which greatly reduces its ability to withstand fishing pressure. The species is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal, recreational, and industrial fisheries across its range with multiple fishing gears including longline, gillnet, and trawl, and is mostly retained for its meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. Species-specific population trend data reveal a subpopulation reduction of >80% in east Australia, with inferred subpopulation reductions of 30â49% in Northwest Atlantic and South Africa over the past three generation lengths (74 years). The species is suspected to be Critically Endangered in the Southwest Atlantic, Mediterranean, and the Arabian Seas region where it is either no longer or rarely encountered. It is suspected to have undergone similar levels of reduction of >80% over the past three generation lengths (74 years) in West Africa and Southeast Asia where there are high levels of historic and current inshore fishing pressure. Overall, the species is estimated and suspected to be declining across its entire range due to exploitation, except for west Australia, with signs of the onset of recovery evident where management measures have prohibited retention or reduced fishing mortality and have been in place for some time, that is in the Northwest Atlantic, South Africa, and east Australia. Globally, it is suspected that the Sand Tiger Shark has undergone a population reduction of >80% over the past three generations lengths (74 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) is a large (to 640 cm total length) coastal and pelagic shark, wide-ranging throughout most temperate and tropical oceans to depths of 1,200 m. The species is very long-lived, up to 73 years, with females not reaching maturity until 33 years, resulting in a long generation length of 53 years. It is caught globally, mostly as bycatch in inshore fisheries by a range of gears, is rarely caught in offshore pelagic fisheries, and is targeted in beach protection programs in Australia and South Africa; however, in some instances these programs release live sharks. Over three generation lengths (159 years), the White Shark is estimated to  be  increasing  in abundance in the Northeast Pacific  and Indian Ocean, and declining in abundance from historic levels in the Northwest Atlantic  and South Pacific. In most regions, declines occurred during the 1980s followed by slow recovery since the 1990s when protection was implemented. Globally, based  on long-term abundance data  and protections instigated in  the 1990s  that have since reduced catches and allowed some recovery, the White Shark population is estimated to have reduced by 30â49% over the last three generations (159 years), and is therefore assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Gulper Shark (Centrophorus granulosus) is a medium-sized (to 176 cm total length) deep-water shark known from a widespread yet patchy global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans. It has been recorded from the continental shelves and upper slopes at depths of 50â1,500 m, and mostly 300â1,100 m. The Gulper Shark is caught as target and incidental catch in small scale and commercial fisheries using a variety of fishing gear. The species is retained for its liver oil, which is considered the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities. Gulper sharks (Centrophorus spp) are known for their slow life histories and targeted fisheries for the species have collapsed over a relatively short time (<20 years). Much of the species' distribution overlaps with intensive fishing activities, but the species may find some refuge at depth. The species is suspected to have undergone large population reduction and ongoing declines across the Indo-Pacific and West Africa. Globally, the Gulper Shark is estimated to have reduced by 50â79% over the last three generations (~83 years), based on abundance data and levels of exploitation, and the species is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The Leafscale Gulper Shark (Centrophorus squamosus) is a medium-sized (to 166 cm total length) deep-water shark known from a widespread yet patchy global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans. It has been recorded from continental and insular shelves and slopes to the abyssÂ at depths of 0â3,366 m, and mostly at depths >200 m. The species is caught as target and incidental catch in small scale and industrial fisheries using a variety of fishing gear. The species is retained for its liver oil, which is considered the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities. Gulper sharks (Centrophorus spp) are known for their slow life histories and targeted fisheries for the species have collapsed over a relatively short time (<20 years). Much of the species' distribution overlaps with intensive fishing activities, but the species may find some refuge at depth.Â The species is estimated to have undergone large population reduction in the Northeast Atlantic, and ongoing declines across the Indo-Pacific, and Â some population increase in the Southwest Pacific.Â Globally, the Leafscale Gulper Shark is estimated to have reduced by 50â79% over the last three generations (158Â years), based on abundance data and levels of exploitation, and the species is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The Little Gulper Shark (Centrophorus uyato) is a small (to 128 cm total length) deep-water sharkÂ known from a widespread yet patchy global distribution in the MediterraneanÂ Sea, Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans. It has been recorded on continental and insular shelves and slopesÂ at depths of 50â1,400 m, and mostly between 400â800 m. The species is caught as target and incidental catch in small scale and industrial fisheries using a variety of fishing gear. The species is retained for its liver oil, which is considered the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities. Gulper sharks (CentrophorusÂ spp) are known for their slow life histories and targeted fisheries for the species have collapsed over a relatively short time (<20 years).Â Much of the species' distribution overlaps with intensive fishing activities, and the speciesÂ is both estimated and suspected to be declining across much of its range.Â Globally, the Little Gulper Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 50â79% over the last three generations (180 years), based on abundance data and levels of exploitation, and the species is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The Black Dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii) is a medium-sized (to 107 cm total length) deepwater shark with a widespread, but discontinuous, distribution mainly in the North Atlantic, but is also found in the South Atlantic in Argentina and South Africa. It is demersal on the outer continental shelves and slopes at depths of 180â2,250 m. This shark was formerly taken as retained or discarded bycatch of industrial deepwater trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries in the North Atlantic. More recently, it is likely to be a discarded bycatch throughout its range due to its low value oil and flesh. While this species is likely to have low productivity and recovery potential, the deeper extent of its range affords it refuge from fishing pressure. There are very low bycatch rates observed in Canada in relation to the minimum estimate of population numbers.Â Population trends in Canada indicate very steep initial declines from the late-1970s until the mid-1990s, thereafter followed by a stable population trend. The deeper depth distribution and broader geographic range make it unlikely that this species declined throughout its range.Â The effort and expansion of deepwater fisheries in Canadian waters has declined since the mid-1990s and a zero Total Allowable Catch was introduced in Europe in 2010. The managed reduction in mortality on this species in the North Atlantic and the stable population index for more than 20 years suggest a genuine change for greater than the five-year qualifying period. Therefore, the Black Dogfish is assessed as Least Concern, although the activity and effect of deepwater fisheries should be monitored, as the status of this species could change in the event of fishery expansion.","The Portuguese Dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis) is a small (to 137 cm total length) deep-water shark known from a widespread yet patchy global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans (excluding the eastern Pacific Ocean). It has been recorded from the continental slope at depths of 128â3,675 m, and mostly at depths >400 m. The species was caught as target and incidental catch in small scale and industrial fisheries in some locations using a variety of fishing gear.Â There has been a number of management measures implemented in recent years for deep-water sharks, and the species has refuge at depth. Still, there is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range. Population declines have been reported in part of its range but increasing trends in others.Â The Portuguese DogfishÂ is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 20â29%Â over the past three generations (111 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","TheÂ Longnose VelvetÂ Dogfish (Centroselachus crepidater) is a small (to 105 cm total length) deep-water shark known fromÂ a widespread yet patchy global distribution in the east Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans. It occurs on the continental slope at depths of 200â2,080 m, and mostly at depths >500 m.Â The species isÂ caught as both targeted and incidental catch inÂ midwater and demersal trawl, surface and demersal longline, and gillnet fisheriesÂ operating across most of its known range, but the species may find some refuge at depth. There have been a number of management measures implemented in recent years, both species-specific and more generally for deep-water sharks. Still, there is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range. Population declines have been reported in part of its range but increasing trends in others. TheÂ Longnose VelvetÂ DogfishÂ is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 20â29%Â over the past three generations (111 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Basking Shark (Cetorhinus maximus) is a very large (to ~1,100 cm total length), highly migratory, filter-feeding shark distributed mainly in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in coastal and pelagic habitats from the surface to 1,264 m. It occurs near the surface in temperate waters and deeper, below the thermocline, in tropical waters. The species has low biological productivity with limited fecundity and late age-at-maturity. Although no longer targeted, it is still caught as bycatch in trawl, trammel nets, and set-net fisheries, and becomes entangled in pot lines. The large fins are extremely valuable in the fin trade. Across regions, there have been some severe  historic decline, however there are indications of some stability  and possible slow recovery since cessation of target fishing and high levels of protection.  The global population may now be beginning  to stabilize, with signs of that from the Northeast Atlantic, although elsewhere there is little information upon which is assess stability. However, abundances  are still estimated to be well below historic levels  and there is  ongoing demand for the high-value fins, and a global population reduction of 50â79% is suspected over the past three generations (102 years). Therefore, the Basking Shark is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","Rabbitfish (Chimaera monstrosa) are aÂ large-sized deep-water chimaera (to at least 150 cm total length) known from a widespread distribution in the Northeast Atlantic, including the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Mediterranean Sea. It has been found on the continental slope at depths of 200â1,663 m, but usually 200â700Â m. Recent genetic research has confirmed separate stocks in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, with limited migration between the two regions. Some evidence of considerable population declines has been reported across part of its range in the Mediterranean Sea, however, these reports could be an artefact of survey limitations (e.g. not sampling the entire species' depth range). Rabbitfish are taken as bycatch in deep-water trawl fisheries across its range. Data from the Northeast Atlantic shows official landings for chimaeras have more than doubled from 2006 to 2014, which may be an outcome of increased retention to replace the current zero-total allowable catch (TAC) for deep-water sharks forÂ International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) member countries. Regional management implementations, including gear restrictions and fisheries closures may offer some refuge from fishing for the species.Â Given the high spatial overlap with fishing across much of its range, a population reduction of 30â49% is suspected over the last three generations (65 years) based on actual levels of exploitation and documented declines in the Mediterranean Sea, thus meeting Vulnerable A2bd.","The Opal Chimaera (Chimaera opalescens) is a medium-sized deep-water chimaera (to at least 110 cm total length) known from a widespread distribution in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, from the western slope of the British Isles and France to Morocco, as well as Greenland. It has been recorded from the continental slope and seamounts at depths of 800â1,975 m. The Opal Chimaera is taken as occasional bycatch in deep-water trawl fisheries across its range. The species was previously confused with the Rabbitfish (Chimaera monstrosa) and may be misreported. Data from the Northeast Atlantic shows official landings for chimaeras have more than doubled from 2006â2014, which may be an outcome of increased retention to replace the zero-total allowable catch (TAC) for deep-water sharks forÂ International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) member countries. This species' occurrence in deep water provides refuge from current fishing activities and at this time, there is nothing to suspect or infer population reduction, and the Opal Chimaera is assessed as Least Concern.","The Frilled Shark (Chlamydoselachus anguineus) has a wide but very patchy distribution in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.Â Although little is known of its life history, this species is likely to have very low resilience to exploitation.Â This deepwater shark is rarely encountered as bycatch in bottom trawl, midwater trawl, deep-set longline, and deep-set gillnet fisheries. As bycatch, this species is sometimes retained for meat or fishmeal, or is discarded. Over the past few decades, deepwater fisheries have expanded and there is some concern that a continued expansion, both geographically and in its depth range, will increase the levels of bycatch of this species. Based on its wide range, however, and that many of the countries where this species has been caught have effective management and depth restrictions to fisheries in place (for example Australia, New Zealand and Europe), this species is assessed as Least Concern. Nonetheless, its apparent rarity and intrinsic sensitivity to over-exploitation mean that captures in fisheries should be tracked carefully (through the collection of species-specific fisheries catch and monitoring data) to ensure this species does not become threatened in the near future.","The Kitefin Shark (Dalatias licha) is a medium-sized deepwater shark (up to 182 cm total length), with a widespread yet patchy distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-West Central Pacific Oceans. It has been recorded on continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of 37 to 1,800 m, but mainly >200 m. Population size and trends are unknown for this species across its entire range, however, it is considered to form distinct regional subpopulationsÂ Over three generations, populations have been documented to decline by >99% in southeast Australia and by 52% in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean. The Kitefin Shark is taken incidentally in midwater and benthic trawl, surface and benthic longline, and setnet fisheries across its range. The species was once targeted in European fisheries, but these fisheries have since closed due to evidence of collapse. Species-specific management actions are established across its range in the Northeast Atlantic, and fisheries restrictions in Australia may indirectly offer some refuge in this region. Where intensive fishing occurs, depletion levels are likely to be consistent with documented declines in core areas of abundance,Â and overall, the global population is inferred to have declined by at least 30%. With much of its distribution still susceptible to fishing, it is inferred that population declines will continue in the future. At this time, the Kitefin Shark is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd+3d.","The Common Stingray (Dasyatis pastinaca) is a medium-sized (to 140 cm disc width) ray that occurs in the east Atlantic and the Mediterranean and Black Sea ranging from the North Sea to Angola. It isÂ demersal on the continental shelf from the surface to a depth of 200 m, but is more commonly found in shallow waters less than 50 m.Â This species is taken as incidental catch in industrial and artisanal fisheries across its range withÂ multiple demersalÂ fishing gears, including trawl, line gear, gillnet, and set net. The meat is generally consumed locally and in the Eastern Central Atlantic it is traded regionally salted-dried or dried and smoked. There is aÂ high-level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across most ofÂ the range of this species. In the Mediterranean and Black Sea, data from comparative trawl surveys (1948 and 1998) conducted in the Adriatic Sea suggest that this species may have decreased in abundance during this period. However,Â standardized catch-per-unit effort estimates from demersal trawl surveys in Sardinia show no majorÂ reductions in population over the past three generation lengths (23 years). In the NortheastÂ Atlantic, it is a less common species, generally showing a low abundance index in comparison to the Mediterranean Sea but may have disappeared from areas where it was previously recorded (e.g., the south of the Bay of Biscay).Â In the Eastern Central Atlantic region,Â there areÂ few recent records from most countries, however, it is suspected to be declining due to theÂ high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure which are a cause for concern. Overall, considering the scale and intensity of unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout itsÂ range, its preference for shallow waters, itsÂ susceptibility to fisheries pressure, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Common Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 30â49%Â over the past threeÂ generation lengths (23 years)Â based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","Tortonese's Stingray (Dasyatis tortonesei) is a medium-sized (to 84 cm disc width) poorly-known ray that occurs in the Mediterranean Sea (but is absent from the Black Sea) from the surface to a depth of 100 m. It has a patchy distribution and its distribution has not been well-defined, but it appears to be limited to the waters off the North African coast and Levantine Basin. Fishing effort has been steadily increasing in recent years throughout the possible range of this species which may impact this species. However, its recent taxonomic resolution precludes assessment of how much this species is caught. Furthermore, the validity of this species remains questioned by some authors which also explains the lack of information on Tortonese's Stingray. As the exact occurrence of the species is not defined, inferences on fishing activities which may take this species (including as bycatch) cannot be made. The population trend is unknown, and further research is needed on taxonomy, distribution, life history, population size and trends, and threats.Â Overall, the lack of information on this species means it cannot be ascertained if it is threatened by fishing pressure. Since it is unknown if fishing is causing a population reduction, there is currently inadequate information available to assess Tortonese's Stingray beyond Data Deficient.","The Birdbeak Dogfish (Deania calcea) is a medium-sized (to 162 cm total length) deep-water shark known from aÂ widespread yet patchy global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans.Â It occurs on continental and insular shelves and slopesÂ at depths of 60â1,600 m, with most individuals recorded at depths >400 m.Â The species isÂ caught as both targeted and incidental catch in midwater and demersal trawl, demersal longline, and gillnet fisheriesÂ operating across most its known range, but the species may find some refuge at depth. There has been a number of management measures implemented in recent years, both species-specific and more generally for deep-water sharks.Â There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines in part of its range but increasing trends in others, and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range. The Birdbeak Dogfish is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 20â29%Â over the past three generations (90 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Common Blue Skate (Dipturus batis) is a medium-sized (to at least 143 cm total length) skate that was once an abundant constituent of the demersal fish community of northwestern Europe. The species is currently known to extend from Iceland, the Rockall Bank and the western Isles of Scotland in the north, the shelf edge, and to the Celtic Sea and to the Bay of Biscay in the south, at depths of 10â600 m. The southern limits and presence in Iberian waters are uncertain. It now appears to be virtually absent from much of the shallower parts of this range and is localised only in areas of the Celtic Sea, the continental shelf edge west of Ireland and the Rockall Bank. The Common Blue Skate may have formerly occupied shelf and slope areas of much of the Northeastern Atlantic, from Norway to North Africa as far as Morocco, but due to unconfirmed taxonomy this part of its historical geographic range remains uncertain. The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in multispecies trawl and tangle net fisheries, which cover much of its shelf and upper slope habitat. Fisheries data indicate that populations of the 'common skate complex' comprised of (Common Blue Skate and Flapper Skate, D. intermedius) underwent an extremely high level of depletion in the central part of their range around the British Isles and Ireland since the early 20th century (within the suspected three generation period of 60 years). Fishing capacity and effort increased substantially over the later half of the 20th century. Accurate international species-specific landings data are lacking, although reported Icelandic landings of the 'common skate complex' have declined. The life history and demography of Common Blue Skate allow limited capacity to withstand exploitation by fisheries; its large body size renders it catchable by fishing gears even from birth. This has been a prohibited species since 2009 in parts of its range and cannot be landed in European Union or United Kingdom waters. Prior to 2009, there was an inferred steep decline of the Common Blue Skate in fisheries landings and an observed, but unquantified, reduction in geographic range size. It is suspected that the Common Blue Skate has undergone a population reduction of >80% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) due to levels of exploitation and range reduction, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd.","The Flapper Skate (Dipturus intermedius) is a large (to at least 254 cm total length) skate that was once an abundant constituent of the demersal fish community of northwestern Europe. It occurs from Scandinavia to the Celtic Sea, possibly extending as far north as Iceland, at depths of 20â1,500 m but the southern limits of the distribution are uncertain. The range has contracted from most inshore areas of its former distribution, but it is still caught in Scottish waters, especially around the Shetland and Orkney Islands and off northwest Scotland, and in very low numbers along the shelf edge and occasionally in the Celtic Sea. The species is targeted and caught as bycatch of multispecies trawl and tangle net fisheries, which cover much of its shelf and upper slope habitat. Fisheries data indicate that populations of D. batis-complex (Flapper Skate and Common Blue Skate (D. batis); known as the 'common skate complex') underwent an extremely high level of depletion in the central part of their range around the British Isles and Ireland since the early 20th century (within the suspected three generation period of 104 years). Fishing capacity and effort increased substantially over the later half of the 20th century. Accurate international species-specific landings data are lacking, although reported Icelandic landings of the 'common skate complex' have declined and current information showing low relative catch rates infer low population sizes. The life history and demography of this species allow little capacity to withstand exploitation by fisheries; its large body size renders it catchable by fishing gears even from birth. This has been a prohibited species since 2009 in parts of its range and cannot be landed in European Union or United Kingdom waters. Prior to 2009, there was an inferred steep decline of the Flapper Skate in fisheries landings and an observed, but unquantified, reduction in geographic range size. It is suspected that the Flapper Skate has undergone a population reduction of >80% over the past three generation lengths (104 years) due to levels of exploitation and range reduction, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd.","Norwegian Skate (Dipturus nidarosiensis) is a deepwater species that occurs in the Northeast Atlantic. It is taken as bycatch in commercial fisheries, but little information is available on landings. This is one of the largest European skates (up to 230 cm total length), and as such, it has low productivity and high catchability, similar to other large skates that have been heavily affected by even moderate levels of bycatch. Skates with a similar range are known to sustain some level of bycatch. Given the status of other Dipturus species in European waters, the low catch levels in surveys and fisheries, and the slow life history of the species, it is suspected to have declined by nearly 30% over the past 30 years (three-generation period). Therefore, the Norwegian Skate is assessed as Near Threatened in the European region as it is close to meet the threshold for threatened under Criterion A2. Further research is required to understand the taxonomy and population status of this species. Fisheries catches and landings should also be monitored.","Norwegian Skate (Dipturus nidarosiensis) is a deepwater species that occurs in the Northeast Atlantic.

The large body size and inferred low intrinsic rate of population increase suggests that this skate will be highly sensitive to exploitation. Two genetically distinct subpopulations exist in the Mediterranean Sea and Northeast Atlantic. In the Northeast Atlantic, the depth range of this species extends down the continental slope to 900 m, but it is rarely encountered on the outer continental shelves. There are limited data on occurrence in Norwegian waters, the Faroes Grounds and the French and Iberian Atlantic shelves but nothing is known of current population trends in the Northeast Atlantic region. Historically, this species may have been more widely distributed in shelf areas.Â In the Mediterranean Sea, this species is found at depths > 200 m and is most frequently captured at depths of 200â500 m in research surveys. It is moderately abundant in the central and eastern Mediterranean Sea, but is now absent from the west. While there has been no indication of a decline in abundance for the last 20 years in Italian waters, it has been absent from research surveys from the Gulf of Lions since 1984 and it is now rarely captured in the shelf areas of the Adriatic Sea.Â The species is assessed as Near Threatened as, considering the status of otherÂ DipturusÂ species in the European region, the low catch levels in surveys and fisheries and the slow life history of the species,Â D. oxyrinchusÂ is suspected to have declined by nearly 30% over the past 30 years (three-generation span), therefore being close to qualify as threatened under criterion A2bd.

It occurs on or near the bottom of outer continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of 10â900 m. The species is caught as target and incidental catch in small scale and industrial fisheries using a variety of fishing gear. The Bramble Shark is retained for its liver oil, which is considered one of the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities. There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, it is thought to be locally extinct from part of its range, and there is a lack of species-specific management across its entire range. The Bramble Shark was both estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 50â79% over the past three generations (48 years) based on abundance dataÂ and actual levels of exploitation, and is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The Great Lanternshark (Etmopterus princeps) is a small (to 75 cm total length) deepwater shark that occurs in the Northwest, Northeast, and Eastern Central Atlantic. It is demersal on continental and insular slopes at depths of 350â2,900 m. The productivity and recovery potential of this shark is likely to be low based on life history traits of other deepwater sharks. Although not targeted by fisheries, it is taken as discarded bycatch of deepwater trawl and longline fisheries over much of its range. The population is estimated to be stable or increasing from catch per unit effort data of Scottish research surveys between 2000â2012, but there are few other data available. Much of the depth range of this widespread species is beyond the reach of deepwater fisheries, which, combined with its small body size and an estimated stable index of abundance. Therefore, the Great Lanternshark is assessed as Least Concern.","The Smooth Lanternshark (Etmopterus pusillus)Â is a small (to 50.2 cm total length) deep-water shark known from a widespread yet patchy global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans. It has been recorded from continental and insular slopes at depths of 0â1,120 m and possibly deeper, and has also been recorded as epipelagic and mesopelagic over deep water.Â TheÂ Smooth LanternsharkÂ is occasionally taken as bycatchÂ in demersal and midwater trawl, demersal longline, and trammel net fisheries across much of its range.Â Species-specific management actions are established across its range in the Northeast Atlantic, and the species is likely to have refuge at depth from fishing activities in parts of its range. The species is not suspected to be close to reaching the population reduction threshold.Â There is nothing to suspect or infer population reduction at this time, and the Smooth Lanternshark is assessed as Least Concern.","The Velvet Belly Lanternshark (Etmopterus spinax) is a small (to at least 55 cm total length) deep-water shark found in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean (from Iceland to Gabon) and in the Western Mediterranean Sea. It occurs on the outer continental shelves and upper slopes at depths of 70â2,000 m, and mostly from 200 to 500 m. The species is frequently reported as incidental catch in deep-water demersal trawl, longline, and handline fisheries across its known spatial range in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Off West Africa, there are a number of European distant-water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species that likely interact with this species. The Velvet Belly Lanternshark is listed as a deep-water shark species in European Union regulations, and various management actions apply to such listed deep-water sharks, including a prohibited on targeted fisheries, a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for shark bycatch in longline fisheries targeting Black Scabbardfish (Aphanopus spp,) and depth limits beyond which gillnets and demersal trawl fisheries are prohibited in some areas. Overall, there is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, some refuge at depth, and deep-water shark management across part of its range. The Velvet Belly Lanternshark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 30â49% over the past three generation lengths (23 years) based on abundance indices and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","  The Tiger Shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) is a large highly mobile shark (to 740 cm total length) with a global range throughout the worldâs tropical and warm temperate oceans. This species has relatively fast growth rates and large litters (on average 26-33 pups) but the likely triennial reproductive cycle reduces its ability to recover from fishing pressure. The Tiger Shark is caught by commercial, recreational, and artisanal fisheries as a target species or bycatch. However, records of Tiger Shark catches by many fisheries globally are still largely unknown. The species is one of the major components in catches from shark control programs that target large shark species in Australia, South Africa, and Reunion Island. Information on stock assessment, population structure and overall population trends are lacking for much of the species' distribution and available trends in catch rates are basedÂ on analyses of the long term shark control programs and on observer surveys from the Western North Atlantic. In Australia, the Queensland Shark Control Program showed declines in catch rates since the 1980s and in New South Wales, evidence of a decline was also seen in the last 20 years. Additionally, a significant reduction of the proportion of mature sharks in catches over 60 years suggests shifts in population structure and raises concerns over possible effects from this program on the Tiger Shark population off New South Wales.Â The decline off eastern Australia is likely to continue while the shark control programs off Queensland and New South Wales remain active. In the U.S. fisheries of the Western North Atlantic, observer surveys variously recorded increases in Tiger Shark relative abundance and no change in abundance. In South Africa, the beach protection program showed a 3% increase per year in Tiger Shark catch rates. The increasing rates in the Western North Atlantic and South Africa seem consistent with the pattern observed in the first 20 years in Queensland and the interpretation of such upward trends should be made with caution. In the Arabian Seas region, the Tiger Shark has been assessed as Vulnerable based on a suspected decline of at least 30% over the past three generations based on levels of exploitation, with the continued demand from the shark fin market suspected to result in further population reduction in the future. Globally, The Tiger Shark is suspected to have declinedÂ by close to 30% over the past three generations (53-68 years) due to exploitation from commercial, recreational, and unregulated fisheries,  as well as shark control programs. AÂ further population reduction is suspected over the future three generation lengths (2018-2086) based on current levels of exploitation that are likely to continue into the future. As such this species is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd+3d).","Tope (Galeorhinus galeus) is a medium-sized (to 200 cm total length) bentho-pelagic shark, widespread in temperate waters in most oceans. It is present across the Northeast, Eastern Central,  Southwest, and Southeast Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, the Eastern  Indian, and across all of the Pacific, except in the Northwest Pacific. It occurs on continental shelves and upper to mid slopes from shallow inshore to well offshore to depths of 826 m, though most frequently to depths of 200 m. Genetic and tagging data support up to six separate subpopulations of Tope and while the species makes extensive movements within each of the subpopulations, there is no evidence of mixing between them. Tope has a particularly low biological productivity with a late age-at-maturity and triennial reproductive cycle. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in industrial and small-scale demersal and pelagic gillnet and longline fisheries, and to a lesser extent in trawl and hook-and-line fisheries. Tope is often retained for the meat and fins but is discarded or released in some areas, in line with regional management measures. Steep subpopulation and stock reductions of >80% over the past three generation lengths (79 years) have occurred in the Southwest Atlantic, southern Africa, and Australia. In the Northeast Atlantic, the subpopulation is estimated to haveÂ undergone a reduction of 76% over the past three generation lengths (79 years). The New Zealand stock is estimated to have undergone a reduction of 30â49% over the past three generation lengths (79 years). In the Northeast Pacific, a dramatic decline in the subpopulation occurred in the early 1940s, with no recovery until 1997â2004 when localized management led to a localized increase in abundance. The consistent steep subpopulation reductions across most of the analyzed subpopulations and stocks together with the lack of movement between the subpopulations are cause for serious concern. Management in Australia, probably aided by the immigration of large mature animals from New Zealand, appears to have stabilized that stock since 2000. The subpopulation in the Northeast Atlantic has been stable in recent years, possibly due to management measures, and there is some recovery in part of the Northeast Pacific. Release of this species is mandatory since 2011 off Canada. Release is mandatory in European Union waters for line-caught Tope. The global population is estimated to have undergone a reduction of 88% with the highest probability of >80% reduction over the last three generations (79 years) due to levels of exploitation, and Tope is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Blackmouth Catshark (Galeus melastomus) is a small (to 90 cm total length) catshark found in the Eastern Atlantic (Faeroe Islands and Norway to Senegal) and the Mediterranean Sea. It occurs on the outer continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 55â2,000 m, and mostly at 200â500 m. The Blackmouth Catshark is reported as incidental catch in both outer shelf and deep-water demersal trawl, longline, and trap fisheries across its geographical and bathymetric ranges but has refuge from some deep-water fishing in some areas. It is now one of the most abundant elasmobranchs across its range in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Off West Africa, there are a number of European distant-water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species that likely interact with this species. There is high distribution overlap with fishing activities, increasing population trends in some parts of its range, and regulations affecting fisheries for deep-water sharks in European Union waters, including depth limits on trawling and gillnets. While the Blackmouth Catshark is no longer listed as a deep-water shark (given the population also occurs in shallow waters), these regulations will have some indirect benefits to the species. There is no evidence of population decline, the species is not suspected to be close to reaching the population reduction threshold, and the Blackmouth Catshark is assessed as Least Concern.","The Atlantic Nurse Shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) is a large (up to 308 cm total length) coastal shark that occurs in the Northwest, Western Central, and Southwest Atlantic from North Carolina, United States of America (USA) to Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil and in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic from Morocco to Angola. It inhabits rocky and coral reefs, seagrasses, mangrove channels, and sand  flats on tropical and subtropical continental and insular shelves from  inshore to a depth of 130 m.In the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic, population trend data from Belize, the US Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic, and the Mexican Caribbean indicate an annual rate of change of 1.2% suggesting an increasing population. However, in Cuba and Costa Rica, there has been an inferred decline in abundance based on a reduction in catches of Atlantic Nurse Shark  despite fishing effort remaining stable. In addition, in other areas of Central America there has been a significant loss of habitat (e.g. coral reefs), which this species relies on and this may contribute to the decline in observations. In the majority of its range, the Atlantic Nurse Shark is targeted and/or captured as bycatch in  commercial, recreational, and artisanal coastal fisheries, including in trawls, beach  seines, gillnets, longlines, and handlines. These fisheries are largely unmanaged and are intensifying in areas outside the USA. It is often retained for its meat and fins, and for its skin for leather.In the Southwest Atlantic, due to the level of intense and largely unmanaged coastal commercial and artisanal fisheries, the rapid and severe decline in other shallow-water coastal elasmobranchs, intense human development that has caused coastal habitat degradation, and the ongoing effects of climate change on coral habitat, it is suspected that this shark has undergone a population reduction of >80%. The Atlantic Nurse Sharks are never targeted in West Africa but when caught they are retained and processed by salt-drying (Ghanaian processors) or by smoking (Guinean processors) and sold in West African markets. Large individuals were observed in the 1990s in Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Guinea, with sizes frequently exceeding 250 cm total length. However, there has been an observed decrease since 2000 in abundance, landings, and average sizes, with a very significant reduction in the proportion of adult females. Given these threats and the recent observed decrease in abundance, it is suspected that the Atlantic Nurse Shark has undergone a population reduction of > 30% in West Africa.Due to the level of intense and largely unmanaged coastal commercial and  artisanal fisheries across its range, the rapid and severe decline in other  coastal elasmobranchs in some areas, intense human development that has caused coastal  habitat degradation, and the ongoing effects of climate change on coral  habitat, overall it is suspected that this shark has undergone a population  reduction of 30â49% over the past three generation lengths (90 years), and the Atlantic Nurse Shark is therefore assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.","The Blackchin Guitarfish (Glaucostegus cemiculus) is a medium-sized (to 265 cm total length) shark-like ray with a wide distribution in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the northern coast of Portugal to Angola, including the Mediterranean Sea. It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore to depths of at least 80 m. Giant guitarfishes have limited biological productivity; the Blackchin Guitarfish has an annual fecundity of 5-24 and an estimated generation length of 15 years.Â The âwhiteâ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)Â are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. Fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across West Africa, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade. Sharks and rays, including the Blackchin Guitarfish, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing. Large regional fishing nations including Mauritania and Senegal have seen significant increases in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century, with considerable artisanal and industrial fishing fleets operating in waters off West Africa. Severe population declines have been inferred for Indo-West Pacific giant guitarfishes from several datasets, and while similar data are not available for West Africa, the levels of documented population reduction (>90% over the last three generation lengths for larger giant guitarfish species) could likely be considered representative of the situation in the eastern Atlantic. Indeed, specific target fisheries for the Blackchin Guitarfish have existed in several countries for many decades. Furthermore, the Blackchin Guitarfish was historically common throughout the northern Mediterranean Sea but has now disappeared from former areas of its range. It is inferred that the Blackchin Guitarfish has undergone a >80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The Spiny Butterfly Ray (Gymnura altavela) is a large (to 260 cm disc width) coastal ray distributed throughout the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, with a discontinuous range in Americas. It occurs on sandy and muddy habitats in the inner continental shelves down to depths of 150 m, but more typically in water less than 50 m deep.This species is commonly taken in industrial and artisanal fisheries using demersal trawl, shrimp trawl, bottom set gillnets, and beach seine nets. They are retained and sold fresh, dried or smoked and are sometimes winged and may be traded internationally. The species was formerly common in coastal areas throughout its range. It is now largely absent from the north and eastern Mediterranean Sea and there have been no records of the species from the International Trawl Surveys in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) since 1994. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. When catch declines are scaled to the conservative three generation lengths of the Spiny Butterfly Ray (33 years) they represent population reductions of 42.5% and 54% in Morocco and Senegal, respectively.In the Northwest Atlantic and Western Central Atlantic, this species is rarely taken as bycatch and is not commercially targeted in U.S. waters. In southern Brazil, catch per unit effort from a research survey revealed a decline from 16.0 to 0.2 kg per hour between 1982â2005 equivalent to a population reduction of 98.8% over the three generation lengths (33 years).In summary, this species is inferred to be Critically Endangered in the Mediterranean Sea and Southwest Atlantic, Endangered inÂ Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, and Least Concern in Northwest and Western Central Atlantic. Overall, it is suspected that the Spiny Butterfly Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50â79% over the last three generation lengths (33 years) due to actual and potential levels of fishing pressure and hence is assessed asÂ EndangeredÂ A2d.","The Narrownose Chimaera (Harriotta raleighana) appears to be the only chimaeroid with a widespread, alebit patchy, circumglobal distribution. It occurs in deepwater on continental slopes at depths of 350 to 2,600 m in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. The species appears to be somewhat common in the northern Atlantic, Northwest Pacific and Southwest Pacific, however, very little is known about its biology. This chimaera is caught in deepwater research trawls and as bycatch in deepwater commercial trawls, but only as a negligible component of bycatch. Expansion of deepwater trawl fisheries could pose a potential threat to the population and its habitats in future, but at present deepwater fishery effort is decreasing in some areas such as Europe with no signs of re-expansion in the near future. At present this species appears to be widespread geographically and bathymetrically and relatively abundant with no immediate threats to the population and is thus assessed as Least Concern.","TheÂ Sharpnose Sevengill Shark (Heptranchias perlo)Â isÂ a small (to 140 cm total length) deep-water shark with aÂ global yet patchy distribution in the Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea,Â and Indo-Pacific Oceans. It occurs in temperate and tropical waters off the continental and insular shelf and upper slope at depths of 0â1,000.Â The species is infrequently caught incidentally in pelagic, midwater, and deep-water industrial and artisanal fisheries across its range.Â There is distributional overlap with fishing pressure, reported and suspected declines in part of its range, and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range.Â TheÂ Sharpnose Sevengill SharkÂ is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 20â29%Â over the past three generations (41 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and is assessed asÂ Near Threatened (close to meeting VulnerableÂ A2bd).","TheÂ Bluntnose Sixgill Shark (Hexanchus griseus)Â is a large (to 550 cm total length) deep-water shark known with a global yet patchy distribution. It occurs in tropical, temperate and borealÂ waters off continental slopes and shelves, and occasionally inshore at depths of 0â2,490 m, but mostly at depths of 200â1,100 m.Â It has large litters but an estimated late age-at-maturity that reduces its capacity to recover from fishing pressure. The species is infrequently caught incidentally in deep-water industrial and artisanalÂ  fisheries across its range.Â There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines in part of its range and increases in others, and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range.Â The Bluntnose Sixgill SharkÂ is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 20â29%Â over the past three generations (160 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed asÂ Near Threatened (close to meeting VulnerableÂ A2bd).","The Small-eyed Rabbitfish (Hydrolagus affinis) is a large-sized deep-water chimaera (to at least 147 cm total length) known from a widespread distribution in the North and Eastern Atlantic Ocean. It has been recorded from the continental slope, seamounts, ridges, and abyssal plains at depths of 300â2,453 m, and is most common >1,000 m. The Small-eyed Rabbitfish is not targeted commercially but is recorded as bycatch in deep-water trawl and longline fisheries. Data from the Northeast Atlantic shows official landings for chimaeras have more than doubled from 2006â2014, which may be an outcome of increased retention to replace the zero-total allowable catch (TAC) for deep-water sharks forÂ International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) member countries. Most of the depth range of the Small-eyed RabbitfishÂ Â is outside of current fishing activities and where there is overlap, regional management implementations, including gear restrictions and fisheries closures, provide refuge from fishing for the species. Based on this, global population trend is suspected to be stable and there is nothing to suspect or infer population reduction at this time. The Small-eyed RabbitfishÂ is therefore assessed as Least Concern.Â ","The Large-eyed Rabbitfish (Hydrolagus mirabilis) is a medium-sized deep-water chimaera (to at least 80 cm total length) known from a widespread distribution in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. It has been recorded from the continental slope at depths of 450â1,933 m, and generally >800 m. The Large-eyed Rabbitfish is not targeted commercially, but is recorded as bycatch in deep-water trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries. Data from the Northeast Atlantic shows official landings for chimaeras have more than doubledÂ from 2006â2014, which may be an outcome of increased retention to replace the zero-total allowable catch (TAC) for deep-water sharks forÂ International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) member countries. The species occurs in deep water outside of most fishing activities, and regional management implementations, including gear restrictions and fisheries closures may offer some refuge from fishing for the species. At this time, there is nothing to suspect or infer global population reduction, and the Large-eyed Rabbitfish is assessed as Least Concern.Â ","The Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) is a large (to 445 cm  total length) pelagic shark, widespreadÂ in temperate and  tropical oceans to depths of 888 m. The species has low biological productivity with a triennial reproductive cycle and late age at maturity. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in coastal and pelagic commercial and  small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, and is generally retained for the high-value meat as well as its fins. Steep population declines have occurred in the north and south Atlantic, with declines also evident, though not as steep in the north Pacific and Indian Oceans. The south Pacific population appears to be increasing but with fluctuating catch rates. The weighted global population trend estimated a median decline of 46.6%, with the highest probability  of 50â79% reduction over three generation lengths (72â75 years), and therefore the Shortfin Mako is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The Porbeagle (Lamna nasus) is a large (to 357 cm total length) pelagic shark with an anti-tropical and disjunct distribution, occurring in the North  Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere in temperate and cold-temperate waters to depths of 1,809 m. There are two separate subpopulations, the North Atlantic  and the Southern Hemisphere. The species has low biological productivity with small litters, late age-at-maturity, and a shorter life span of 26 years in the North Atlantic compared to 60 years in the Southern Hemisphere. Globally, the species is targeted and caught incidentally in coastal and pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, as well as by rod and reel, and is often retained for the high-value meat as well as its fins. Steep declines have occurred in the North Atlantic; with declines also evident, though not as steep, in the Southern Hemisphere. The North Atlantic  subpopulation reduction was 50â79% over three generations (58.5 years)  and the Southern Hemisphere subpopulation reduction was <20%  over three generations (114.9 years). The overall estimated median reduction was 26.5%, with a 41.5% probability of <20% reduction and 45.5% probability of >30% reduction over three generations. Expert judgement elicitation was used to estimate that globally,  the reduction  is 30â49% over three generations (58.5 and 114.9 years) and therefore,  the  Porbeagle is assessed globally as Vulnerable A2bd.","Sandy Skate (Leucoraja circularis) is a relatively large species found in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Historically it was found around 100 m depth on sandy and muddy bottoms, though it is now mainly found in slightly deeper waters along the edge of the continental shelf and upper slope. It is taken as bycatch in multi-species trawl fisheries and offshore bottom longlines.   In the Northeast Atlantic, landings and catch rates for this skate have declined since the early 1990s. The species has completely disappeared from trawl surveys in the North Sea and Celtic Seas in 1996 and 1997, respectively. Scottish surveys still catch it around northwest Scotland and the Porcupine Bank, but at greater depths (180â500 m) than historically reported. This suggests a contraction of the speciesâ range as a result of trawl fisheries. Records from the outer shelf are scarce, and while survey catch rates have been stable for this species now in the areas it has been considered most abundant since 2001, these rates are very low, therefore do not imply population stability. Misidentification has also prevented reliable estimates of population decline, potentially masking the disappearance of this species from certain areas. For example, Belgium and France are still suspected to be misreporting the species in confusion with Smalleyed Skate (Raja microocellata).   Given the paucity of records from the outer continental shelf, the large declines in landings in recent years, the contracted range to deeper waters, and the very low catch levels seen in the Porcupine Bank survey, Sandy Skate is suspected to have largely in the declined Northeast Atlantic. Fishery independent data for mature individuals are limited and careful monitoring of subpopulations across its range is required to determine accurate population trends for mature individuals.  In the Mediterranean Sea, the occurrence of this species has decreased in the last 60 years. It is no longer encountered in the Gulf of Lions or the Adriatic Sea where it was once relatively common. Mediterranean-wide scientific trawl surveys from 1995â1999 recorded this species in only 12 of 6,336 trawls. Benthic trawl effort has increased significantly during the last 60 years and fishing pressure continues within this speciesâ depth range.Â Given the current rarity of Sandy Skate in the Mediterranean Sea, evidence of potential local extinction from two locations, and its likely low intrinsic rate of increase suggested by its large body size and large size at maturity, together with the declines suspected on the Northeast Atlantic, the species is suspected to have declined overall by more than 50% in the last three generations (29 years). Thus, the species is assessed as Endangered.","Shagreen Skate (Leucoraja fullonica) is an offshore species, usually occurring on the outer parts of the continental shelf, at depths of 30â550 m, and it has occasionally been recorded beyond 550 m in the Mediterranean Sea. In the Northeast Atlantic this skate is taken as bycatch in demersal trawl and longline fisheries throughout much of its range. Reported French landings were more than 370 tonnes in 1983, but since 1984 annual landings have been more stable and averaged about 75â150 tonnes. Recent captures of this species in Scottish surveys have been made in waters > 200 m deep, suggesting that its range has been constricted to deeper waters. However, accurate trends in abundance are hard to determine due to changes in survey techniques, as well as some uncertainty in the taxonomic identification in earlier surveys. It is suspected that there have been continuing population declines of 30-50% over three generations for the Northeast Atlantic subpopulation.Â         Few data are available on this skate in the Mediterranean Sea, where it was recorded in only seven of 6,336 tows between 1994 and 1999 at depths ranging from 10â800 m during the International Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean. More recent records from 2008â2009 identified ten specimens in the southern Adriatic Sea, an area that this species was previously suspected to be absent from, although these records could be misidentifications. This species is rare in Mediterranean trawl surveys. However, this skate likely has a low intrinsic rate of increase suggested by its large body size and large size at maturity. Therefore, further analyses of survey data and close monitoring are needed to elucidate the long-term distribution and relative abundance of this species.It is assumed that the rate of decline in the Mediterranean Sea is at least the same or worse than the NEA due to near absence of effective fisheries management there. Therefore it is inferred that this species meets the threshold for Vulnerable, given an estimated 30-50% overall decline in a three generation span from the NEA (from ICES 2012) and suspected 30-50% decline throughout European waters overall in a three generation span. This species potentially meets the threshold for Endangered and thus should be monitored, particularly in the Mediterranean.","This small-bodied skate is relatively widespread and endemic to the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. It occurs at depths between 20 and 500 m, and is more common at about 200 m in the Mediterranean Sea. It is taken as bycatch in mixed demersal fisheries through much of its range and used in some areas. It is apparently rare in the Mediterranean Sea and has disappeared in some areas, remaining in areas less intensively trawled. It may have some capacity to withstand moderate fishing pressure compared with larger skates that are highly sensitive to rapid depletion as a result of their limiting life-history characteristics.  Abundance trends from the Northeast Atlantic are inconsistent as there is considerable spatial and temporal variability in catch. This species seems to have increased in some areas following previous declines, while in other areas the opposite pattern is seen.However the total Northeast Atlantic population is not considered to have declined significantly. However, there have been observed declines in heavily trawled areas of the Mediterranean Sea, although there are other areas where it is less heavily fished, and there is a lack of new information on trends.Â Based on the apparent ability of this skate to withstand higher levels of fishing than other larger elasmobranchs, and the lack of negative trend data throughout the majority of its European range, the species is assessed as Least Concern. More information on stock identity is required, and the status of stocks in those areas where it is exploited most in the Northeast Atlantic (e.g., Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay) need to be better assessed and monitored.","The Goblin Shark (Mitsukurina owstoni) is a large deepwater shark (to 410 cm total length (TL), possibly 617 cm TL), with a widespread but patchy global distribution across the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans. It has been recorded on outer continental shelves, upper slopes and off seamounts at depths of 0-1,300 m, but mainly at depths between 270-960 m. It also appears to be mesopelagic. Population size and trends for this species are unknown. The Goblin Shark is rarely caught as incidental bycatch in deepwater benthic gillnet, benthic longline, trawl, and surface drift net fisheries, with most captures reported from Japan. There are no species-specific management actions in place at this time. Although there is a lack of information on its biology and population size and trends, it is possible to infer from the limited fisheries interactions across its range that this species occupies areas outside those available to fisheries, although it may also be naturally rare. At this time, there is nothing to infer any population decline and the Goblin Shark is assessed as Least Concern.Â ","The Spinetail Devil Ray (Mobula mobular) is a large (to 350 cm DW) pelagic species which is circumglobal in tropical and subtropical waters from the surface to 1,112 m deep. Within this broad range, populations appear to be patchily distributed and the global population size is unknown. The species has a conservative life history, producing only one pup on average every 1â3 years, and likely has a very low intrinsic rate of population increase. The Spinetail Devil Ray is a large component of targeted fisheries and a bycatch of many small- and large-scale fisheries, with much of this catch unreported or aggregated as Mobula species. The depths and regions used by the Spinetail Devil Ray coincide with many artisanal and industrial fisheries, raising concerns about previously unreported and continued bycatch. Steep population declines are evident in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including India and Indonesia. The lack of species-specific catch records, fishing effort, and population data necessitates the use of genus-wide inferences to assess some population reductions, however notable declines in landings of 50â96% over 15 years have been documented in Indonesia, and extinction is suspected in areas with intense and growing fishing pressure. The Spinetail Devil Ray has a widespread global range and in some parts of its distribution such as Australia, New Zealand and some Pacific countries, the threat would likely be far less than elsewhere due to lower fishing pressure and strong fisheries management. The Spinetail Devil Ray is used locally and sometimes nationally, and often traded internationally, with the rise of the valuable gill plate trade increasing pressure on the species. Unlike for some other mobulid species, the development of localized marine protected areas is unlikely to provide this species any significant protection from fisheries due to its large-scale movements. Based on actual levels of exploitation, steep declining population trends, a conservative life history, and the increasing trade demand, a global population reduction of 50â79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years) is suspected, with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018â2056). The Spinetail Devil Ray is therefore assessed as Endangered (EN A2bd+3d).","TheÂ Starry Smoothhound (Mustelus asterias)Â is a small (to 140 cm total length) shark found in theÂ Northeast and Eastern Central Atlantic and Mediterranean SeaÂ (but absent from the Black Sea)Â from Scotland and southern Norway down to Western Sahara and the Canary Islands. It isÂ demersalÂ on the continental shelf from inshore to a depth of 199 m.Â The Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea are considered different stocks, based on differences in reproductive biology, limiting potential for external recruitment in the event of population depletion.Â The species isÂ caughtÂ inÂ demersalÂ trawl, gillnet, trammel net,Â andÂ longline fishing gear.In the northern parts of the Northeast Atlantic it has little market value and is often discarded. In the Mediterranean SeaÂ and Eastern Central Atlantic, smoothhounds (MustelusÂ spp.) are valued for human consumption and are often retained and marketed.Â No reliable species-specific fisheries catch data are available because landings data often refer to all smoothhounds combinedÂ with Tope (Galeorhinus galeus) or spurdogs (SqualusÂ spp.).Â Abundance trends in fishery independent survey data fromÂ Northwestern AtlanticÂ areÂ estimated to be increasing.In the Mediterranean Sea,Â abundance trends inÂ fishery independent trawl survey data show that this stock of Starry Smoothhound has been declining in both the Gulf of Lions and the Adriatic Sea over the past 50 years. It should however be noted that the situation in the Mediterranean Sea may be worse than estimated given the grouping of smoothhounds in landings data and consequent masking of species-specific population trajectories. No information is currently available on subpopulation trends in the southern Mediterranean Sea and northwestern coasts of Africa, althoughÂ the Starry SmoothhoundÂ is also caught and landed there in relatively intensive coastal fisheries.Â Taken together this species is estimated to be increasing in the Northeast Atlantic and inferred to have undergone a population reduction  of ~70% % of the past three generation lengths (39 years) in the  Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Due to similarly high fishing pressure along the continental shelves of the Eastern Central Atlantic it is suspected that this species has also undergone a similar level of  population reduction there.Assuming the Northeast Atlantic region comprises two-thirds of the range of Starry Smoothhound, it is suspected that overall this species has undergone a population reduction of 20â29% over the past three generation lengths (39 years) due to actual levels of exploitation andÂ this species is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d). ","The Common Smoothhound (Mustelus mustelus) is a medium-sized (to 176 cm total length) shark that occurs inÂ the Mediterranean Sea, east Atlantic Ocean and Western Indian Ocean ranging from Portugal to the east coast of South Africa. It occurs in shallow coastal waters and on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 5â438 m,Â but is more commonly found in shallow waters at depths of 5â50 m. The species is taken as targeted and incidental catch in demersal trawl, line gear, set net, and trammel net fisheries across its range. It is retained for human consumption and is widely marketed as fresh, dried-salted, or dried and smoked meat while fins enter the international trade.Little species-specific fisheries catch data are available across most of its range because of frequent misidentifications with other smoothhounds (Mustelus spp.) with overlapping distributions. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across its range.Â Both catch and fishery-independent scientific survey data available from the Mediterranean Sea suggest that significant declines have occurred. Trend analyses of relative abundance and stock biomass in Mauritania and South Africa, respectively, reveal population reductions of >80% and >50%, respectively over the past three generation lengths (53 years). AcrossÂ the rest of its range, this species is still landed inÂ relatively large quantities compared to other shark species but declining catch-per-unit-effort has been reported (e.g., Gabon).Â Overall, there is limitedÂ species-specific reporting, as well as a lack of species-specific time-series data from theÂ remaining range of the species. However, considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in fisheries surveys in several localities, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its limited refuge at depth, itsÂ susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in otherÂ sharks, it is suspected that the Common Smoothhound has undergone a population reduction of 50â79%Â over the past threeÂ generation lengths (53 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed asÂ Endangered A2bd.","The Blackspotted Smoothhound (Mustelus punctulatus) isÂ a small (to 122 cm total length) shark found in the Mediterranean SeaÂ and to the Western Sahara in the Eastern Central Atlantic.Â It is demersal on the continental shelf and slope from the surface to a depth of 300 m.Â This species is frequently mistaken with other more abundant smoothhound (MustelusÂ spp.)Â species,Â particularly the Common Smoothhound (M. mustelus).The Blackspotted Smoothhound appears to be very rare in the western, central, and eastern Mediterranean Sea, but more common along the North African coast, especially on the coasts of Tunisia and Libya. Like other smoothhound species in this region, it is taken as bycatch inÂ demersalÂ trawlsÂ as well asÂ gillnet, trammel net and line gear. Landings data are often grouped and therefore species-specific information is not currently available. Smoothhounds areÂ valued forÂ human consumption in many areas of the Mediterranean SeaÂ and northwest Africa and are often retained and marketed.Â This species is apparently rare,Â butÂ it may be unknowingly fished throughout its range. There is evidence that other smoothhound species have declined, making further investigation a priority. Considering that the fishing effort in the Mediterranean Sea has eitherÂ remainedÂ the same or increased,Â catch data suggest declining trends from 2008 to 2012. These declines in the Mediterranean combined with its more common abundance elsewhere lead to a suspected population reductionÂ of 30â49% over the past three generation lengths (54 years) due to levels of exploitation, and the Blackspotted SmoothhoundÂ  is assessed as VulnerableÂ A2d.","The Common Eagle Ray (Myliobatis aquila) is a large (to 150 cm disc width) eagle ray that occurs from the eastern Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea, to Kenya in the Western Indian Ocean.Â It is demersal and semi-pelagic in shallow coastal waters on the continental shelf and offshore toÂ aÂ depth ofÂ 537 m. The species is a bycatch of industrial and artisanal trawl and net fisheries, as well as recreational fisheries in South Africa, and is retained for human consumption or discarded. It is suspected to have limited biological productivity similar to other myliobatid rays (including a low fecundity of 3â7 pups per litter), limiting its capacity to sustain fishing pressure. This species often swims in groups and thisÂ schooling behaviour exposes it to a high likelihood of large quantities being captured by trawl and gillnets in one haul.There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species.Â In the northwest Mediterranean Sea, data from landings and trawl surveys showed that catches declined in the 1970s, and the species disappeared from catches and landings altogether from the 1980s to 1995. Despite its former presence, it has not been documented from trawl surveys in theÂ western, central, and easternÂ Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Central Atlantic, and very few records are available from its remaining range across the Eastern Central Atlantic and Western Indian Ocean despite ongoing artisanal fisheries monitoring projects. In South Africa, the Common Eagle Ray is estimated to be decreasing but stable and this is likely the only portion of its range whereÂ pressure is not as high. Overall, considering these declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in trawl surveys and fisheries in several localities where is previouslyÂ occurred, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its aggregating behaviour, its limited productivity, and noted declines inÂ eagle rays in general in several parts of its range, it is suspected that the Common Eagle Ray has undergone a population reduction of >80% over the past threeÂ generation lengths (36 years) based on abundance dataÂ and actual levels of exploitation and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Common Eagle Ray (Myliobatis aquila) is a large (to 150 cm disc width) eagle ray that occurs from the eastern Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea, to Kenya in the Western Indian Ocean.Â It is demersal and semi-pelagic in shallow coastal waters on the continental shelf and offshore toÂ aÂ depth ofÂ 537 m.

It is endemic to the Northeast Atlantic and appears to be relatively rare. It was only known from the type series until further records of this species were obtained with the development of deepwater fisheries on the continental slopes and scientific exploration cruises in the Northeast Atlantic. This species is occasionally taken as the bycatch of deepwater trawl fisheries, but most of its depth range lies beyond the reach of the main deepwater fisheries. Given its limited interaction with fisheries and deep range, it can be inferred that the risk of exploitation is low. For this reason, Blue Pygmy Skate is assessed as Least Concern.","The Smalltooth Sand Tiger (Odontaspis ferox) appears to have an extensive, albeit fragmented, distribution in tropical and warm-temperate latitudes of the world's oceans. Apart from about five shallow water dive locations where it has been seen repeatedly, the Smalltooth Sand Tiger is known from fewer than 200 records suggesting that it is rarely encountered (or reported), or naturally has low population numbers. However, new records continue to accumulate, including several recent captures and a number of photographs and video recordings taken in deepwater at oceanic islands and on submarine seamounts and ridges. With this new distributional information, it is becoming evident that the Smalltooth Sand Tiger is probably continuously distributed across the oceans and around the peripheries of the continents. Although larger and bulkier, this species is morphologically very similar to the Sand Tiger (Carcharias taurus) and is presumed to have a similarly very low reproductive capacity (producing only two pups every two years). This likely very low fecundity makes it potentially susceptible to local extinction, even at seemingly small capture rates. Although probably not specifically targeted, there are commercial landings of the Smalltooth Sand Tiger from bottom trawls, set-nets and line gear in many parts of the world including the Mediterranean Sea, Japan, Indonesia and (occasionally) Australia. Demersal trawl fisheries off Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa operate in areas of known and likely occurrence. Off the southeastern coast of Australia, fishery-independent surveys indicated a decline of over 50% in catches of the Smalltooth Sand Tiger after 20 years of trawling on the upper slope (200â650 m) off New South Wales. Similar declines are likely to have occurred in other parts of its range impacted by fisheries, such as the in the Mediterranean Sea where the decline of the Smalltooth Sand Tiger is suspected to match or even exceed that in Australia; regionally, the species is currently assessed as Critically Endangered in the Mediterranean. Although it is more often found in depths greater than 200 m (max. depth recorded is 880 m), occurrences of small aggregations of the Smalltooth Sand Tiger in shallow water at a number of locations (eastern tropical Atlantic, eastern and southwestern Pacific Ocean) suggest that the species may be more vulnerable to fishing pressure than previously assumed, and may also be susceptible to coastal habitat impacts similar to those that affected the Sand Tiger (C. taurus).Globally, there are many parts of its distribution where there seems to be little or no fishery activity, and the species is protected in the waters of some countries e.g. Croatia, Malta, Spain (Mediterranean coast), Colombia (Malpelo Island Sanctuary), Australia (New South Wales), and New Zealand. However, a precautionary assessment of Vulnerable is considered appropriate because of documented and suspected local declines, the species' apparent rarity, its presumed very low fecundity and high vulnerability to exploitation, and its continued bycatch in fisheries in a number of countries.","The Angular Roughshark (Oxynotus centrina)Â is a small (to 150 cm total length) deep-water sharkÂ found in the Northeast and Eastern Atlantic Ocean (from Norway to South Africa) and the Mediterranean Sea (absent from the Black Sea). It occurs on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 35â805 m. The AngularÂ Roughshark is very infrequently reported as bycatch across its range in demersal trawl and longline fisheries. Off West Africa, there are a number of European distant-water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species that reach the depth limit of the species. The Angular RoughsharkÂ is listed as a deep-water shark species in European Union regulations, and various management actions apply to such listed deep-water sharks, including a prohibition on targeted fisheries, a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for shark bycatch in longline fisheries targeting Black Scabbardfish (AphanopusÂ spp.), and depth limits beyond which gillnets and demersal trawl fisheries are prohibited in some areas. There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines of deep-water sharks in part of its range, suspected local extinctions in the Mediterranean, and some relevant management across part of its range. TheÂ Angular RoughsharkÂ is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 50â79%Â over the past three generation lengths (60 years) based on actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Sailfin Roughshark (Oxynotus paradoxus)Â is a small (to at least 118 cm total length) deep-water sharkÂ endemic to the Northeast and Eastern Central Atlantic, from Scotland to Senegal and possibly southwards to the Gulf of Guinea. It occurs on the continental slope at depths of 265â1,104 m. The Sailfin Roughshark is very infrequently reported as bycatch in demersal trawl fisheries across its rangeÂ and may inhabit depths beyond the reach of some regional fishing activities. Off West Africa, there are a number of European distant-water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species that reach the depth limit of the species. The Sailfin RoughsharkÂ is listed as a deep-water shark species in European Union regulations, and various management actions apply to such listed deep-water sharks, including a prohibited on targeted fisheries, a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for shark bycatch in longline fisheries targeting Black Scabbardfish (AphanopusÂ spp), and depth limits beyond which gillnets and demersal trawl fisheries are prohibited in some areas.Â Oxynotus species are highly susceptible to population decline from fishing with estimated population reductions of 80% over three generation lengths (60 years) in areas with high fishing effort.Â There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines of deep-water sharks in part of its range, some relevant management across part of its range, and possible refuge at depth. TheÂ Sailfin RoughsharkÂ is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30â49%Â over the past three generation lengths (60 years) based on actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Blue Shark (Prionace glauca) is a large (to 380 cm TL) oceanic pelagic shark wide-ranging throughout tropical and temperate waters from the surface down to 1,000 m deep. The species has the highest known population growth rates among pelagic sharks; it matures young and has large litters. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, although most of the take is bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters. Generally, Blue Sharks are retained for the fins, although the demand for meat is likely increasing. The steepest population declines have occurred in the North and South Atlantic, with lesser declines in the Indian Ocean, and increases in the Pacific. The weighted global population trend estimated a median decline of 7.3%, with the highest probability of <20%  reduction over three generation lengths (30â31.5 years). However, due to uncertainty in some of the regional estimated trends, inferred steep historic declines in the Mediterranean Sea, high levels of unregulated exploitation, and high levels of international trade in meat and fins, experts estimated a global population reduction of 20â29% over three generation and the Blue Shark is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Smalltooth Sawfish (Pristis pectinata) has been wholly or nearly extirpated from large areas of its former range in the Atlantic Ocean by fishing (trawl and inshore netting) and habitat modification. Negative records from scientific surveys, anecdotal fisher observations, and fish landings data over its historic range infer a population reduction of  â¥95% over a period of three generations (i.e., 1962 to present). The remaining populations are now small, and fragmented. The species can only be reliably encountered in the Bahamas (where suitable habitat is available) and the United States (Georgia south to Louisiana). It is rare but present in Honduras, Belize, Cuba, Sierra Leone, and possibly Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania. Threats to Smalltooth Sawfish still exist today in areas where sawfish are unprotected and habitat modification (mangrove removal) and inshore netting still occurs.","The Largetooth Sawfish (Pristis pristis) formerly had a widespread tropical distribution, consisting of four subpopulations (Eastern Atlantic, Western Atlantic, Eastern Pacific and Indo-West Pacific). A recent taxonomic review has shown that P. perotteti (Atlantic) and P. microdon (Indo-West Pacific) are synonymous with P. pristis and this Red List assessment replaces the previous (2006) assessments for those species. The Largetooth Sawfish is a large (6.5+ m total length) euryhaline species, with juveniles occurring in freshwater systems and adults in marine and estuarine environments (although in Lake Nicaragua, individuals spent much, if not all, of their lives in freshwater). All subpopulations have undergone significant population declines and the species is now apparently extinct in many former range states. In most others, recent records are rare (e.g., there have been very few records in the Eastern Atlantic in the last decade). In the Western Atlantic, current records indicate that Largetooth Sawfish can only be regularly encountered today in the Amazon River basin, the Rio Colorado-Rio San Juan area in Nicaragua, and possibly some remote areas of French Guiana, Suriname, and Guyana. In the Indo-West Pacific, northern Australia represents a globally important remaining population centre. Overall, a population reduction based on a reduction in extent of occurrence (EOO) of â¥80% over a period of three generations (i.e., 1960s to present) is inferred. Despite protection in some range states (e.g., Australia, India, Brazil, United States, Mexico; it is possibly extinct in the latter two range states), threats are ongoing and the species is assessed globally as Critically Endangered. ","The False Catshark (Pseudotriakis microdon) is a wide-ranging but sporadically captured, large-bodied, deepwater shark with most records from the Northern Hemisphere (it appears rarer in the Southern Hemisphere). It may be cosmopolitan, but as yet has not been recorded from the South Atlantic or Eastern Pacific. Primarily inhabits the continental and insular slopes at depths of 100 to 1,890 m, but also occasionally occurs on the continental shelf. The False Catshark reaches a maximum size of 296 cm total length. This species displays a modified form of oophagy, the first confirmed oophagous species outside the Lamniformes. Fecundity is low (two embryos per litter), and this, combined with an estimated long gestation period and presumed slow growth rate may place populations at risk of localised depletion if the species becomes more regularly caught. At present the species is of no interest to fisheries but is taken sporadically as bycatch in deepwater longline and trawl fisheries. Deepwater fisheries are generally expanding globally, and given the biology of this species, bycatch of this uncommon to rare fish may be of concern for any localised populations in areas where fishing may be concentrated, such as deepwater reefs or seamounts. However, the species has a widespread geographic and depth range, and is continuing to be documented in new locations in the deepsea, and is therefore assessed as Least Concern.","The Pelagic Stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) is a medium-sized ray (to 80 cm disc width) that is circumglobal throughout the tropical and temperate oceans and is perhaps the only stingray to inhabit open ocean waters. It occurs in the epipelagic zone mostly to depths of 100 m, although it has been recorded to 381 m. The species is taken as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries around the  world. It isÂ mostly discarded, but is retained and utilized in some areas. Post-discard survival rates are thought to be low in  some regions where the species are often discarded with jaw damage. Relative abundance trends across the world appear to fluctuate over time with no consistent significant trend. In general, abundance trends appear to be stable or increasing in some regions, although recent data from US pelagic fisheries observers from the Western North Atlantic over the period 2004â2015 indicated a decline of 40%. While this trend is not considered representative of the global trend, it does suggest some caution is needed. Given the species' widespread occurrence and apparent resilience to fisheries, it is assessed as Least Concern at this time, with the caveat that catches should continue to be monitored.","Starry Skate (Raja asterias) is distributed primarily in the Mediterranean Sea. It is caught as bycatch by bottom trawl, trammel net, and gill net fisheries especially in the Italian, French and Spanish seas. This skate is relatively fast growing with an early age of maturity (the three generation span is ~ 19 years), high fecundityÂ and a short life span, which indicates that it is relatively productive and resilient to fishing pressure.Â There have also been steep declines in landings over a 25 year period (1969-1994) in the Gulf of Lions. It is suspected that these trends are likely to be representative throughout its range. Starry SkateÂ is inferred to have undergone a decline of 20% throughout its distribution, and it is therefore assessed as Near Threatened as it is close to qualify as threatened under Criterion A2. Further information on its status in the southern Mediterranean Sea is needed.","The Blonde Ray (Raja brachyura) is a relatively large-bodied skate, endemic to the northeast Atlantic and western Mediterranean Sea. Occurs on soft substrates to depths of about 150 m in the northeast Atlantic and mainly from 10-300 m depth in the Mediterranean Sea. Targeted in areas where it is locally abundant and taken as bycatch in mixed demersal fisheries using trawl, gill nets and longlines elsewhere in its range. It is apparently rare in the Mediterranean Sea, captured in only 21 of 6,336 tows in Mediterranean-wide trawl surveys conducted between 1994-1999 (at depths of 10-800 m). It is not certain whether the Blonde Ray has always been rare there; no data are currently available on historical abundance or trends for this region and there is no evidence to suggest it was ever common. The lack of data on this apparently rare species prevents an assessment beyond Data Deficient in the Mediterranean Sea at present, but given that demersal fishing pressure is relatively intense throughout large areas of its range there an assessment of catches is a priority. This species is more common in the northeast Atlantic where it is taken as bycatch and also targeted where sufficiently abundant. No formal stock assessments have been undertaken for this species. Although it is locally abundant in some areas, survey data indicate that declines have occurred. Medium sized skates showed marked declines in relative abundance, especially the Blonde Ray, in comparable research trawl surveys conducted in three locations around the British Isles in 1901-1907 and 1989-1997. Furthermore, the percentage composition of the Blonde Ray decreased by close to 30% between the two survey periods. Demersal fishing pressure is still high throughout large areas of the Northeast Atlantic and declines are inferred elsewhere, where specific data are not available. This species probably has limiting life-history characteristics, like other relatively large skates, making it vulnerable to depletion. Given observed and inferred declines, continued high levels of exploitation and this species' rarity in the Mediterranean Sea, it just fails to meet the criteria for Vulnerable A2bd globally and is assessed as Near Threatened. Improved monitoring of population trends and further assessment of the Atlantic and Mediterranean populations are a priority.","This is an amended version of the 2005 assessment. The assessment has been amended to reflect newly available information which places this species in the genus Raja (formally Malacoraja).Â This assessment is based on the information published in the 2005 shark status survey (Fowler et al. 2005).This demersal batoid is one of the most abundant elasmobranchs in the Northeastern Atlantic. The Thornback Skate (Raja clavata) is widespread, although the taxonomy of specimens from South Africa requires additional study. There is some limited evidence of a decline in landings in the northern part of the East Atlantic range of this species and management of the fishery is required. However, declines have not been as serious as reported for other large rajids.","The Smalleyed Ray (Raja microocellata) is restricted primarily to the Atlantic coasts of Northwest Europe, from Gibraltar to the British Isles, although it has also been recorded further south, to Western Sahara, northwestern Africa. It is found on the continental shelf, mostly at <100 m depth. The range of this skate is smaller than many of the more common European skates and rays. It favours sandy bays and is only recorded as abundant at a few sites (e.g., Bristol Channel, UK and Bertheaume Bay, France). Raja microocellata is taken as bycatch in trawl and set net fisheries, with most landings from the Bristol Channel and is commercially important for ports in parts of southern England. Given its restricted and patchy, fragmented geographical distribution and localised abundance local populations may potentially be vulnerable to declines caused by over-fishing, habitat degradation and other anthropogenic disturbance. This species is assessed as Near Threatened on the basis of suspected declines approaching 30%, as a result of high levels of exploitation, close to meeting the criteria for Vulnerable A4d. Fishery independent data for mature R. microocellata are limited and careful monitoring of populations of this species is required to determine accurate population trends of mature individuals.","The Brown Skate (Raja miraletus) is a small (to ~60 cm total length) skate found on continental shelf and upper slope soft-sediment habitats at depths of 50â555 m, ranging widely from Spain (Bay of Biscay) through the Mediterranean Sea to Morocco and Madeira (Portugal). This species is caught as bycatch throughout much of its range in the Mediterranean Sea and Northeast Atlantic, but it appears to be increasing in abundance.Â The small body size and short generation span (7.2 years) suggest the Brown Skate isÂ able to withstand current levels of exploitation and it is therefore assessed as Least Concern.","This small skate is widespread in the inshore waters and shallow shelf seas of the Northeast Atlantic and is common throughout the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in the east (Aegean Sea) and the western central area (coasts of Tyrrhenia, Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily). The bulk of the population appears to exist between 100 and 500 m in the Mediterranean. Populations of Raja montagui appear to be stable throughout its range despite being commonly landed in fisheries. Their small body size is likely to mean this species has greater resilience to fishing impacts compared to larger-bodied skate species. R. montagui is common in landings from fisheries and trawl surveys throughout much of the Northeast Atlantic and although accurate species-specific landings data are not available, catch rates in fishery-independent surveys indicate that catches are stable, possibly increasing in certain areas. It is also captured in trawl fisheries as bycatch in the Mediterranean and although temporal fluctuations of the abundance have occurred, populations appear to be stable in most parts of the Mediterranean. Therefore this species is assessed as Least Concern. Given intense trawling pressure within its range, future trends and bycatch levels should be closely monitored.","The Speckled Skate (Raja polystigma) is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. This relatively small skate (up to 60 cm total length) mainly inhabits soft bottoms on the continental shelf at depths of 100-400 m. It shows a wide geographic range in the Mediterranean Sea (mostly western and western central areas) where it is moderately common. It is part of the bycatch in fisheries using bottom trawl nets, but is also fished with gillnets, longlines and handlines in artisanal fisheries. Although little is known of the effect of fisheries on population size, its entire range overlaps intensively trawled regions. Given its small-body size, it is likely to be able to withstand moderate levels of fishing pressure. Speckled Skate is therefore assessed as Least Concern, although the status of this endemic species should be monitored.","Mediterranean regional assessment: Endangered (EN)The Rough Skate (Raja radula) is medium-sized (up to 70 cm total length) and may be endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. It appears rare in the northern basin but is locally abundant around the Balearic Islands and Tunisia. It occurs in coastal waters to 300 m depth, more commonly found at <40 m depth in some areas such as the Balearic Islands. Records from Portugal and the northern coasts of Morocco require verification and may be misidentifications of other Raja species (skates). The Rough Skate is commonly taken as bycatch of demersal trawl, gillnet, trammel net, bottom longline, and purse seine fisheries, although no species-specific catch data are available. Given that it i) appears to be restricted to the Mediterranean Sea where it has recently declined in certain regions, and ii) ongoing relatively intense fishing pressure overlaps with parts of its range, the Rough Skate is assessed as Endangered under Criterion A4b. A decline of >50% is estimated for the three generation period (27 years) in the European region. Further investigation is required to determine this speciesâ full range, abundance, interaction with fisheries, and population trends.","The Undulate Ray (Raja undulata) is a medium-sized, inshore skate that has a patchy distribution in the northeast and eastern central Atlantic, with discrete areas where it may be locally common (southwestern Ireland, eastern English Channel, southern Portugal). It also occurs in the Mediterranean Sea, where it appears to be uncommon. The Undulate Ray occurs in shelf waters down to about 200 m depth, although it is more common in shallow waters. This species is taken as utilised bycatch by trawl, trammel net and other demersal fisheries. Its patchy distribution means that populations are widely separated, possibly with little exchange. In the areas where it is known to be locally common, available data suggest declines have occurred. Time series catch data from Tralee Bay, southwestern Ireland (where this species forms a discreet subpopulation) show that catches of this species have declined by 60-80% since 1981, although they fluctuate each year. The species has also traditionally been observed in English beam trawl surveys in the eastern English Channel, but has been absent in recent years. French landings of this species from the Celtic Seas have declined steeply during the past decade. Another major area of occurrence is southern Portugal, where it is the most common skate captured by the mixed species trammel net fisheries. Species-specific landings data are not collected, but overall landings of Raja species have decreased by 29% between 1988 and 2004 in this area. This medium-bodied skate has limiting life-history characteristics that make it more vulnerable to exploitation than smaller skate species (three year generation period of ~45 years). Given the Undulate Ray's life-history characteristics, documented species-specific declines in some areas and the declines in aggregate catch data, significant declines are also inferred to have occurred off southern Portugal. Although no specific data are available from western Africa, intensive artisanal and demersal trawl fisheries operate throughout its inshore range there. Due to the patchy distribution of this inshore species, and that it is thought to have declined in major areas of its range, it is assessed as Endangered.","Bigelowâs Skate (Rajella bigelowi) is a small (to 55 cm total length) skate that occurs in the Northwest, Northeast, and Eastern Central Atlantic from the Gulf of Mexico north to the USA, Canada, Greenland, to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Rockall Trough to Spain, Azores, Morocco and Guinea-Conakry. It is demersal on continental and insular slopes at depths of 625â2,200 m depth, and possibly on abyssal plains down to 4,155 m. It is occasionally taken as bycatch of deepwater bottom trawl fisheries, but is typically discarded and not utilized. The majority of this skate's range is beyond the depths of current fisheries and the population is inferred to be stable.Â There is nothing to infer or suspect population reduction at this time and this species is assessed as Least Concern.","Round Skate (Rajella fyllae) is a small (to 56 cm total length) skate found in the North Atlantic from Canada to the Bay of Biscay and Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This skate occurs on continental and insular shelves slopes at 150â2,050 m deep. It is regularly taken as bycatch of deepwater bottom trawl fisheries but likely discarded and not utilized, but its deepwater range places the majority of the population outside the range of current fishing pressure and the population is increasing throughout much of its range.Â There is no evidence of population decline and the species is not suspected to be close to reaching the population reduction threshold, and this species is assessed as Least Concern","Mid-Atlantic Skate (Rajella kukujevi) is a poorly known, deepwater species endemic to the Northeast Atlantic. It is found at depths of 775â1,500 m and is most common below 1,000 m. Relatively few individuals have been captured since it was originally described and very little data are available. Little is known of the speciesâ biology, though it is likely to have inherent limiting life history characteristics similar to other deepwater skates, making it potentially vulnerable to exploitation. It is rarely taken as bycatch by deepwater trawl fisheries targeting deepwater teleost fishes. This speciesâ deep depth range may afford it refuge from fishing pressure in some areas, though some fisheries operate throughout the shallow end of its bathymetric range. Mid-Atlantic Skate is assessed as Least Concern because of the suspected minimal overlap between its range and deepwater fisheries operations. Efforts should be made to assess catch and population trends, and this assessment should be revisited as soon as data are available.","The Common Guitarfish (Rhinobatos rhinobatos) is a medium-sized (to 162 cm total length) guitarfish that occurs in the eastern Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea, from the southern Bay of Biscay to Angola. It is demersal on the continental shelf to a depth of 180 m. The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in a range of industrial and artisanal gears including demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet. The meat is consumed locally and traded regionally as a dried or dried and smoked product, while the fins likely enter the international trade. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade.Sharks and rays, including the Common Guitarfish, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Central Atlantic by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing and the local disappearance of some species. In the Mediterranean Sea,Â where there has been a long history of fisheries exploitation and which is ongoing, the Common Guitarfish was historically abundant throughout the western, central, and eastern regions but is now locally extinct from former areas of its range.Off the Eastern Central Atlantic, large regional fishing nations including Mauritania and Senegal have seen significant increases in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century, with considerable artisanal and industrial fishing fleets operating in these waters. Other guitarfishes and wedgefishes have undergone severe declines (e.g., the Blackchin Guitarfish (Glaucostegus cemiculus)) and fishing pressure in shallow coastal habitats is unlikely to decrease. Severe population declines have been inferred for Indo-West Pacific guitarfishes from several datasets, and while similar data are not available for West Africa, the levels of documented population reductions (>90% over the last three generation lengths) for larger guitarfish species are likely to be representative of the situation in the Eastern Central Atlantic. Indeed, specific target fisheries for the Common Guitarfish have existed in several countries for many decades, and severe population reductions have been noted in Mauritania, Senegal, and in other countries. This species is not likely to have any refuge from fishing given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, industrial, and illegal fishing coupled with the continued targeted fisheries for guitarfishes in many countries.It is suspected that the Common Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of >80% over the past three generation lengths (42 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Atlantic Longnose Chimaera (Rhinochimaera atlantica) is a large-sized deep-water chimaera (to at least 147 cm total length) known from a widespread but patchy distribution in the Eastern and Western Atlantic Ocean and off the east coast of South Africa and Mozambique in the Western Indian Ocean. It has been found on the upper and mid continental slopes at depths of 400â1,800 m. The Atlantic Longnose Chimaera is not known to be targeted in commercial fisheries but is occasionally reported as bycatch by demersal trawl and the effect of fishing, if any, on the species is unknown. Further information is required on its distribution, ecology, life history, and interactions with deep-water fisheries. However, this species has refuge in deep water outside current fishing activities across its wide range and there is nothing to suspect or infer population reduction. The Atlantic Longnose Chimaera is therefore assessed as Least Concern.","The Lusitanian Cownose Ray (Rhinoptera marginata) is a large benthopelagic (to 200 cm disc width) ray that occurs in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea, from Portugal to northern Angola. It is found from nearshore to a depth of 100 m.The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in a range of industrial and artisanal gears including demersal trawls, longlines, purse seines, and gillnets. The meat is consumed locally and traded regionally and internationally as a dried and smoked or fresh and frozen product. This species forms large schools, meaning that large numbers can be fished in a single haul and there is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across its range, with demand for shark and ray product increasing.It is apparently uncommon across most of the western and central Mediterranean but more common in the eastern region (Levantine basin), where there has been a long history of fisheries exploitation and which is ongoing. In West Africa, this species is still commonly caught in several countries, but significant population declines have been reported. In this region, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have led to steep declines in other large species of rays, and there is no reason not to suspect that this species has also been reduced in numbers in that area. Heavy fishing pressure has caused declines in other Rhinopterids.Overall, fishing pressure is high and increasing across the West African range of the Lusitanian Cownose Ray and there has been a long history of fisheries overexploitation in the Mediterranean Sea part of its range which is ongoing. This species is not likely to have any refuge from fishing given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, industrial, and illegal fishing coupled with the continued targeted fisheries in several countries. The species is susceptible to fisheries, has schooling behaviour, limited productivity (one pup per year), and there are noted declines in other large rays (e.g., eagle rays) across its range. It is suspected that the Lusitanian Cownose Ray has undergone a population reduction of >80% over the last three generation lengths (83 years) based on actual or potential levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The size of this large benthic skate renders it particularly susceptible to capture by fishing gears, which in combination with its life history parameters and population demography allow little capacity for it to withstand exploitation by fisheries. This species is likely to be caught as bycatch to multispecies trawl fisheries which operate on much of the continental shelf and slope, coinciding with this species habitat. Based on anecdotal and trawl survey data, this species has undergone dramatic declines in abundance and substantial reductions in geographic range within the Mediterranean and the Northeast Atlantic, and it is listed in the Barcelona and Bern conventions.\n\nThe data available indicate that Rostroraja alba was formerly captured frequently in the northwestern Mediterranean during the 1960s and off Tunisia and Morocco in the early to mid 1970s. It is now considered rare and is believed to have undergone a significant but currently unquantifiable decline in abundance and extent. This, in combination with the continued and potentially increasing threat from fisheries call for this species to be assessed as Endangered in the Mediterranean. Similar declines in geographical range have occurred in the Northeast Atlantic and anecdotal evidence suggests this species, including localized populations have declined severely e.g., in the Irish Sea. There is a high potential for population decline in the Bay of Biscay, the Iberian coast, and in the Celtic Sea. The collapse of a directed long-line targeted fishery in Brittany highlights the incapacity for this species to withstand fisheries exploitation. The data presented here for the Northeast Atlantic indicate that this species is assessed as Critically Endangered. \n\nOn this basis, this species is globally assessed as Endangered, however this will need to be revisited once information from West and Sub-Equatorial African range of its distribution is available (specifically with data from South African trawl fisheries).","The Smallspotted Catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) is a small (to 100 cm total length) catshark found in the Northeast and Eastern Central Atlantic Ocean (from Norway and the British Isles to Senegal and possibly Benin) and the Mediterranean Sea. It occurs on the continental shelf and upper slope from nearshore to a depth of 800 m. The Smallspotted Catshark is reported as incidental catch in demersal trawl, longline, and gill net fisheries across its geographic and bathymetric range. It is now one of the most abundant elasmobranchs across its range in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays have been exploited by semi-industrial fisheries since the 1950s. Off West Africa, there are a number of European distant-water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species that operate in the deeper depth limits of the species. There is high distribution overlap with fishing pressure, increasing population trends in some parts of its range, and some relevant management in its Northeast Atlantic range. There is no evidence of population decline, the species is not suspected to be close to reaching the population reduction threshold, and the Smallspotted Catshark is assessed as Least Concern.","","The Nursehound (Scyliorhinus stellaris) is a medium-sized (to 162 cm total length) catshark known from the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (from Norway to Portugal) and the Mediterranean Sea.Â It occurs on the continental and insular shelf, mostly from nearshore to about 60 m, with occasional specimens reported from deeper water (to a depth of 380 m).Â The species is caught incidentally in artisanal and industrial demersal trawl, gill net, demersal set long line, handline and fixed demersal net fisheries operating across all its known range. There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines in part of its range but an increasing population in others, possible local extinctions in the Mediterranean Sea, and a lack of species-specific management across its range. Population recovery may be affected by low levels of interconnectivity between isolated populations around those island groups far from the continental coast.Â The Nursehound is suspected to have undergone a global population reduction of 30â49% over the past three generation lengths (48 years)Â based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed asÂ Vulnerable A2bd.","The Knifetooth Dogfish (Scymnodon ringens) is a small (to 110 cm total length) deep-water shark known from the Northeast and Central Atlantic (Scotland to Senegal) and the Southwest Pacific (New Zealand) Oceans. It has been recorded from the continental slope at depths of 200â1,600 m. The species is caught incidentally in trawl and longline fisheries operating across all its known range, but the species may find some refuge at depth. There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines in part of its range but a stable population in others, and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range. The Knifetooth Dogfish is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 30â49%Â over the past three generations (111 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Greenland Shark (Somniosus microcephalus) is a large (to at least 640 cm total length) sleeper shark that occurs in theÂ North Atlantic from USA and Canada to Greenland in the west and from Portugal to the Barents Sea and East Siberian Sea in the east. This species occurs at depths from the surface down to 2,647 m, but mainly at 300â500 m in Baffin Bay. This species potentially has the world's longest generation span of 274 years, however, we conservatively use a generation length of 150 years, and consider a generation length of 50â75 years.Â The maximum intrinsic rate of population increase (rmax)Â of Greenland Shark is 0.032 yearâ1Â which is nearly half the lowestÂ rmaxÂ previously calculated for any shark or ray.Â There have been target fisheries for this species for its for liver oil since the 13th century with an increase in fisheries since the 17th Century (one generation length). Target fishing pressure increased up to the 1900s, ending in the 1940â1960s with the development of synthetic oils. Since then, it has been taken as discarded bycatch of demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries with approximately 3,500 individuals caught each year in the Northwest Atlantic, Arctic Ocean and Barents Sea. A population reconstruction, based on catch records, reveals that the Greenland Shark has been declining since the early 1600s with steepest declines beginning in the early 1800s through to the 1940s whereupon target fisheries were ended. Since then there is ongoing mortality from bycatch, but the overall fishing mortality is significantly reduced but is close to a level that may cause a decline, depending on bycatch survival rates and population generation length and resilience. The Greenland Shark was estimated to have declined by 57% in the 420 years since the 1600s, but is likely to have increased by 3% in the past century (1920â2020). The global estimated population reduction is 59% over the equivalent of three generation lengths (450 years),Â but this value could range fromÂ 11.7â72.9 depending on whether the generation length is shorter (50â75 years) or longer (274 years). The historic and current catch levels are uncertain, in particular the population reconstruction is likely to be highly sensitive to the catch of adults versus juveniles and post-release survival rate. Most catches seem to comprise juveniles, which might be more sustainable, but the abundance of adults seems very low and uncertain. Further, climate-change induced reduction in Arctic sea ice is providing greater access for fishing fleets and there is a projected loss of Arctic sea ice by 50% over the next 100 years. Taken together, the long history of fishing, ongoing exploitation (albeit at significantly lower levels than historically), and an extremely conservative life history, and climate change impacts of declining Arctic sea ice, it is suspected that the Greenland Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30â49% over the last three generations (450 years).Â Therefore, the Greenland Shark is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Little Sleeper Shark (Somniosus rostratus) is a small (to 131.4 cm total length) deep-water shark known from a patchy distribution in the Northeast and Western CentralÂ Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. It has been recorded from the continental shelf and slope at depths of 180â2,734 m. The Little Sleeper Shark is caught incidentally in demersal trawl and longline fisheries across its range off Europe and in the Mediterranean Sea. Sleeper sharks (SomniosusÂ spp) are known for their slow life histories, and the Little Sleeper Shark is susceptible to capture in the shallower half of its bathymetric range, where most of the population appears to occur. It appears to have a relatively small known range compared to other sleeper sharks, but the species will have refuge at depth in the Northwest Atlantic (off Cuba) where there are no known deep-water fisheries. The species is not suspected to be close to reaching the population reduction threshold.Â There is nothing to suspect or infer population reduction at this time, and the Little Sleeper SharkÂ is assessed as Least Concern.","The Scalloped Hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini)  is a large (to 420 cm total length) coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark that is circumglobal in warm-temperate and tropical seas, from the surface and intertidal zone to depths of 1,043 m. The global population structure varies between males and females; males  move across ocean basins, while females only move regionally. The species is caught globally as target and bycatch in  pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet  fisheries, and is retained for the meat and fins. The Scalloped Hammerhead has undergone steep declines in all oceans, with some signs of stabilization  and possible recovery in response to management only in the Northwest  Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. The weighted global population trend estimated median reductions of 76.9â97.3%, with the highest probability of >80% reduction over three generation lengths (72.3 years), and is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Great Hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) is a large (to 610 cm total length) coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark, wide-ranging in tropical and warm temperate seas to depths of 300 m. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in coastal and pelagic large- and small-scale longline, purse seine, and  gillnet fisheries, and is often retained for the fins. It has a  long lifespan of up to 44 years and only breeds once every two years,  which combined with high bycatch mortality, makes it susceptible to depletion where it is taken in unmanaged  fisheries. The Great Hammerhead appears to have undergone steep declines in the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and in the Atlantic prior to management measures, where slow recovery may now be occurring in the Northwest Atlantic. The global population is estimated to have undergone reductions of 50.9â62.4%, with the highest probability of >80% reduction over three generation lengths (71.1â74.4 years). There is a lack of data from the Pacific, limited regional representation of some time-series, intensive fisheries in data-poor regions that are suspected to have driven significant declines, and uncertainty about levels of exploitation that are potentially similar to those of the Scalloped Hammerhead (S. lewini) (which has been assessed as globally Critically Endangered). Expert judgement elicitation thus used a precautionary approach and concurred with the highest probability of reduction of >80% over three generation lengths (71.1â74.4 years). The Great Hammerhead is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Smooth Hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena) is a large (to 400 cm total length) coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark, wide-ranging in temperate and tropical seas to depths of at least 200 m, possibly 500 m. Population growth rates of 0.225 per year are among the fastest known for pelagic sharks and the fastest of the hammerhead species. The Smooth Hammerhead is caught globally as target and bycatch in coastal and pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, and is often retained for the fins, and sometimes the meat. It has undergone steep historic declines in the Atlantic but the introduction of management measures may be allowing slow recovery, lesser declines in the South Pacific, and increases in the Indian Ocean. The weighted global population trends estimated a median reduction of 21.8â64.8%, with the highest probability of <20% and >80% reduction over three generation lengths (72.3 years). The Northwest Atlantic data that includes the period after management changes led to the lower estimated global reduction. However, there is uncertainty  in  some of the catch data, limited regional representation of some time-series, and intensive-fisheries in data-poor regionsÂ that are suspected to have driven declines, balanced with the  relatively lower level of artisanal fisheries threat to this species compared to that of the Scalloped Hammerhead (S. lewini) and Great Hammerhead (S. mokarran), due to its generally more temperate distribution. Expert judgement elicitation thus inferred a global population reduction of 30â49% and the Smooth Hammerhead is therefore assessed as Vulnerable A2bd. More robust species-specific data and monitoring of catches is  required  to improve certainty of catch estimates for a future assessment  of  this species.","The Spined Pygmy Shark (Squaliolus laticaudus)Â is one of the world's smallest (to 27.5 cm total length) sharks and is known from a widespread yet patchy global distribution in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. It has been recorded from continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of 10â1,800 m,Â and has also been recorded as epipelagic and mesopelagic over deep water.Â The species is infrequently reported as bycatch in deep-water trawl and demersal longline fisheries.Â The Spined Pygmy SharkÂ may become susceptible to future fishing activities if mesopelagic fisheries develop. The species is not suspected to be close to reaching the population reduction threshold.Â The global population is suspected to be stable based on levels of fishing effort in its rangeÂ and refuge in deep water outside of current fishing activities. There is nothing to suspect or infer population reduction at this time, and the species is assessed as Least Concern.Â ","The Spiny Dogfish (Squalus acanthias) is a medium-sized (to 200 cm total length) shark known from a global distribution in boreal and temperate waters in all oceans, except for the North Pacific and Southern Ocean.Â It has been recorded in both inshore and offshore marine habitats from the surface to 1,978 m, with most records occurring at depths <600 m.Â Historically, the species has been intensively fished across most of its range, taken as targeted and incidental catch by hand line, demersal gillnet, trawl, dredge, and longline in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries.Â Its distribution overlaps with intensive fishing activities while its aggregative behaviour increases its catchability. The large-scale, targeted fishing pressure that led to overfishing of the North Atlantic stock has decreased markedly, although incidental catch in multi-species fisheries continues. Retention bans have been implemented in the European Union. In the Northeast Atlantic, considerable stock recovery has been achieved through long-term, science-based catch limits. In the South Pacific, New Zealand has a long history of managing Spiny Dogfish fisheries through quotas. Elsewhere, management measures are lacking. Given the history of Spiny Dogfish depletion that has taken decades of management to address, as well as the speciesâ inherent susceptibility to incidental capture and overfishing, precautionary, stringent management is advised for all stocks. Globally, the population of Spiny Dogfish is estimated to have reduced by 30â49%Â over the last three generations (51 years), based on abundance data and levels of exploitation, and the species is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Longnose Spurdog (Squalus blainville) is a small (to 92 cm total length) spurdog known from the eastern Atlantic Ocean (from France to South Africa) and Mediterranean Sea, including the Black Sea. It is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 15â1,500, and mostly shallower than 780 m. The Longnose Spurdog is taken as incidental catch in demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries across its range and is often misidentified with other spurdogs (Squalus spp). There is a long history of extensive and intensive fisheries across the species' known range in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Off West Africa, there are a number of European distant-water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species that may interact with this species. Some species-specific trends indicate the species has undergone considerable (>80%) population reduction over the past three generation lengths (40 years) in the Mediterranean Sea, however, there is high uncertainty in the data due to taxonomic issues. There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines in part of its range, and high uncertainty in accurate catch data. The true effect of fishing on the Longnose Spurdog is unknown and since it is unknown if fishing is causing a population reduction, there is currently inadequate information available to assess the species beyond Data Deficient.","The Sawback Angelshark (Squatina aculeata) is a medium-sized demersal shark (to 175 cm total length) that formerly was a common and important predator over large areas of its coastal shelf and continental slope (30 to 500 m depth) habitat in the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Atlantic. Most of this region is now subject to intense demersal fisheries, and the species is highly susceptible at all life stages to bycatch in demersal trawls, set nets, dredges, and bottom longlines operating through most of its range and habitat. Industrial and artisanal fishing pressure is intense and often unregulated in this region and it is suspected that this will continue at the current level or increase in the future. As a result of its limiting life history characteristics and bycatch in fisheries with steadily increasing effort and capacity, its abundance has declined dramatically during the past 50 years. It is now extremely uncommon throughout most of its range, and many records of angel sharks are only reported to genus level. Along the West African coast this species is taken as occasional bycatch of industrial trawl and artisanal gillnet fisheries and was reported as common in Russian-led surveys during the 1970s and 1980s. Portuguese landings data from the fleet operating off Morocco and Mauritania, aggregated for the three native angel shark species combined indicates a 95% decline in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from 1990 to 1998. The available data from this region indicate that there are very few recent records. It is suspected that the species has undergone overall declines of at least 80% across its range over the past three generation lengths (~45 years), and bycatch is likely to continue. Therefore, this species is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd+3cd.","The Smoothback Angelshark (Squatina oculata) is a medium-sized (to 160 cm total length) demersal shark. Formerly the species was a common ambush predator over large areas of its coastal and outer continental shelf soft sediment habitat at depths of 10 to 500 m in the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Atlantic. Most of this region has, and continues, to be subject to intense demersal fisheries, and the species is highly catchable from birth as retained bycatch in demersal trawls, set nets, bottom longlines, and dredges. As a result of its limiting life history characteristics (slow growth and late maturation) and fisheries that have steadily increased in effort and capacity, its abundance has declined dramatically during the past 50 years to the point where it is now apparently locally extinct in parts of the northern Mediterranean and West African coasts. It is now extremely uncommon throughout most of the remainder of its range and is thus inferred to have undergone a decline in area of occupancy. Along the West African coasts this species is caught and retained as bycatch in industrial trawl and artisanal gillnet fisheries, and was reported as common in Russian surveys during the 1970s and 1980s. Portuguese landings data from the fleet operating off Morocco and Mauritania, aggregated for Smoothback and Sawback Angelsharks, indicates a 95% decline in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from 1990-1998. Industrial and artisanal fishing pressure is intense and often unregulated in this region; it is suspected that this will continue at the current level or increase in the future leading to further declines due to bycatch. Overall declines of 80% or more are suspected over the past three generation lengths (~45 years) for this species based on a lack of presence in landings despite increasing effort, which is expected to continue into the future. Therefore the Smoothback Angelshark is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd+3cd. ","The Angelshark (Squatina squatina) is a large (to 244 cm total length) demersal shark that formerly was a common predator at depths down to 150 m over large areas of its coastal shelf sandy habitat in the Northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Black Seas. Most of this region is now subject to intense demersal fisheries; from birth the species is highly susceptible to bycatch in demersal trawls, set nets, dredges, and bottom longlines, which operate through most of its range and habitat. It is also caught in recreational fisheries, through shore and boat angling, as well as spearfishing. Habitat loss in some areas as a result of coastal commercial and tourism development is also likely to have affected this species. Heavy exploitation combined with limiting life history traits, such as low productivity, have led to dramatic declines during the past 50 years. The species is now extremely uncommon throughout most of its range, with the exception of the Canary Islands, which have been identified as a unique stronghold for the species where individuals are sighted regularly by divers and fishers. In other areas of its range, occasional sightings are reported, specifically along the coast of Wales (Cardigan Bay) and the West Coast of Ireland, the Tyrrhenian Sea, North Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, and Mediterranean coasts of Turkey, Algeria, and Egypt. Its status should be confirmed in these areas and existing and new conservation measures should be implemented and/or introduced as a matter of urgency.    It is inferred that this species has undergone a decline in area of occupancy (AOO). Comparisons of indices of abundance and biomass in various parts of its range of occurrence over extended periods dating back to the early 20th century show declines >90% with no evidence of recovery. Based on these inferred historical declines, a suspected decline in extent of occurrence (EOO) and AOO, and the contemporary rarity of the species, it is suspected that declines of at least 80% (but likely closer to 90%) have occurred over the past three generations (~45 years). Therefore, the Angelshark is listed as Critically Endangered A2bcd. ","The Great Torpedo Ray (Tetronarce nobiliana) is a large (to 180 cm total length) electric ray with a widespread, yet patchy, distribution in the Eastern Atlantic (from Denmark to South Africa) and Indo-Pacific (Australia and New Zealand) and in the Mediterranean Sea. It occurs on the continental and insular shelves and slopes to depths of at least 925 m. The Great Torpedo Ray is infrequently reported as incidental catch in demersal trawl, longline, set net, and trammel net gear.Â The species is reported to make long pelagic migrations often near the surface, and has been reported from mid-water trawls. The species likely has refuge with depth across much of its range. Further information is required on biology, distribution, population size and trends of the Great Torpedo Ray, as well as interactions with fisheries.   There is no evidence of population decline, the species is not suspected to be close to reaching the population reduction threshold, and the Great Torpedo Ray is assessed as Least Concern.","The Marbled Torpedo Ray (Torpedo marmorata) is a medium-sized (to 100 cm total length) electric ray found in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean (northern Europe to South Africa) and the Mediterranean Sea. It occurs on the continental shelf and slope from nearshore to depths of at least 370 m. The Marbled Torpedo Ray is taken as incidental catch in bottom trawl, longline, set net and coastal trammel net fisheries across its range. Torpedo rays (Torpedo spp.) have low economic value and have generally been discarded in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, and may be discarded or retained across Africa. In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays have been exploited by semi-industrial fisheries since the 1950s. Over the years, targeted shark and ray fisheries have expanded across many countries and are likely increasing fishing pressure on this species. There are a number of European distant-water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species off the coasts of Africa that reach the depth limit of the species. The Marbled Torpedo Ray is estimated to be stable in the Mediterranean Sea and suspected to be declining in the Northeast and Central Atlantic where historic and current fishing pressure is high. The Marbled Torpedo Ray is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30â49% over the past three generation lengths (48 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Ocellate Torpedo (Torpedo torpedo) is a small (to 60 cm total length) torpedo ray that occurs in the Eastern and Central Atlantic Oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea (absent from the Black Sea). It is demersal on the continental shelf and slope from nearshore to a depth of 320 m.This species is taken as incidental catch in bottom trawl, longline, set net, and trammel net fisheries across its range. Torpedo rays (Torpedo spp.) have low economic value and while retained in some countries (e.g., Senegal), they are discarded in others (e.g., across the Mediterranean Sea and Gabon). If released alive, post-release survival is likely to be high.There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across most of the range of this species. In the Mediterranean Sea, trend analyses of standardized catch-per-unit effort estimates from trawl surveys in the upper Tyrrhenian Sea reveal an increasing population over the past three generation lengths (30 years). However, in other locations such as the Adriatic Sea, records of this species have become rare over the last two decades. In the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which comprises most of the species' range, there are a number of distant water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species within the depth limit of this species. In Mauritania, catch data from research surveys indicate a decline equivalent to a 73% population reduction over the past three generation lengths (30 years). Across the rest of this region, there are few recent records from most countries, likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. However, populations may also have already been reduced prior to recent studies in the area. The Ocellate Torpedo is estimated to be stable and increasing in some areas of the Mediterranean Sea. It is suspected to be declining across West Africa where historic and current fishing pressure is high, although it might have some refuge from artisanal fisheries with depth across some of its range. It is suspected that the Ocellate Torpedo has undergone a population reduction of 30â49% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Velvet Dogfish (Zameus squamulosus) is a small (to 109.4 cm total length) deep-water shark know from a widespread yet patchy global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans (excluding the eastern Pacific Ocean). It has been recorded from the continental slope and oceanic ridges, and as epipelagic over deep water, from the surface to 1,511 m. The Velvet Dogfish may be subject to local variability in its susceptibility to capture and likely has refuge at depth. It is infrequently reported from surface longline, as well as demersal longline and trawlÂ fisheries. The species is not suspected to be close to reaching the population reduction threshold.Â There is nothing to suspect or infer population reduction at this time, and the Velvet DogfishÂ is assessed as Least Concern."],"IUCN_habitat":["The Duckbill Eagle Ray is demersal and semi-pelagic in estuaries, lagoons, and on the continental shelf toÂ aÂ depth ofÂ 150Â m (Wallace 1967, LastÂ et al.Â 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 222 cm disc width (DW) with males mature at ~80â100 cm DW and females mature at ~ 83â100 cm DW (CapapÃ©Â et al. 1995, Last et al. 2016). Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous with a gestation length of 5â6 months, litter sizes of 3â6 pups, and a size-at-birth of ~22â45 cm DW (SeckÂ et al. 2002, LastÂ et al.Â 2016). There is no information on this species's age-at-maturity and maximum age and hence, generation length was inferred based on data for the Bat Eagle Ray (Myliobatis californicus). TheÂ Bat Eagle RayÂ has an age-at-maturity of five years and a maximum age of 24 years and, thus, a generation length of 14.5 years (Martin and Caillet 1988). TheÂ Duckbill Eagle RayÂ has a larger maximum size (222 cm DW) than the Bat Eagle Ray (180 cm DW), and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred to be 17 years for the Duckbill Eagle Ray.Â ","The Bigeye Thresher is found in coastal waters over continental  shelves, sometimes close inshore in shallow waters, and on the high seas  in the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones far from land; it is also  caught near the bottom in deep water on continental slopes (Compagno  2001). It occursÂ mostly below 100 m depth but has been recorded to 955 m (Compagno 2001, Coelho et al. 2015). It is present near the surface at night and makes deep dives during the day (Clarke et al. 2015). It reaches a maximum size ofÂ 484 cm total length (TL) (Compagno 2001); males mature at 245â300 cm TL; females mature at 282â355  cm TL (ChenÂ et al.Â 1997, LiuÂ et al.Â 1998, Moreno and Moron 1992, Stillwelli and Casey 1976, VargheseÂ et al.Â 2017). Size at birth is 64â140 cm TL (Golani 1996, ChenÂ etÂ al.  1997, Bauchot 1987). The gestation period is 12 months with average  litter sizes 2â4 pups per litter, usually two, and the reproductive cycle is likely annual (Compagno 2001,Â VargheseÂ et al.Â 2017).  Of the thresher sharks, the Bigeye Thresher has the lowest rate of  annual increase, estimated at 1.6% under sustainable exploitation  (SmithÂ et al.Â 2008), or 0.002â0.009 (CortÃ©s 2008, DulvyÂ et al.Â 2008). Observed female age-at-maturity is 12â13 years and maximum age 20 years in Taiwan, Northwest Pacific (Liu et al. 1998). These Taiwanese age data were used to generate growth curves that encompass a wider age and size range than the observed data, and thus were used to estimate female age-at-maturity at 9 years and maximum age at 28 years; generation length is therefore 18.5 years (Chen and Yuan 2006).","The Common Thresher is oceanic and coastal to depths of 650 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Wiegmann 2016). It is more frequently found close to land and in temperate waters (Ebert et al. 2013). The species reaches a maximum size of 573 cm total length (TL), and possibly 635 cm TL; size at birth is 120â150 cm TL, males mature at 260â420 cm TL, and females mature at 260â465 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013, Young et al. 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous oophagous with litter sizes of 2â6 pups and an annual or biennial reproductive cycle (Gubanov 1978, Cailliet and Bedford 1983, EbertÂ et al.Â 2013, Gervelis and Natanson 2013). The potential annual rate of population increase under sustainable fishing is higher than that of the Pelagic ThresherÂ and Bigeye ThresherÂ and has been estimated at 0.254 (Dulvy et al. 2008). Female age at maturity is estimated at 13 years and maximum age is 38 years based on bomb-radiocarbon validated ages from the Northwest Atlantic (Natanson et al.  2016). In the Eastern Central Pacific, age-at-maturity estimates are  much younger, though not validated with female age-at-maturity at 5.3  years and maximum age at 22 years off California  (Smith et al. 2008). It is possible these are regional  differences in life history parameters, but adopting a precautionary  approach, the validated bomb radiocarbon ages are used for both regions  to give a generation length of 25.5 years.","The Thorny Skate is demersal on continental and insular shelves and slopes from nearshore to 1,400 m depths, usually at 25â440 m (Last et al. 2016).Â There is regional variation in maximum size, it reaches a maximum size of 66 cmÂ total length (TL)Â (North Sea) to 111 cm (NW Atlantic)Â (Walker 1998, Ebert and Stehmann 2013).Â Reproduction is oviparous with fecundity ranging from 10 to 45 egg cases per year (Templeman 1987), but only 38% of eggs hatching (COSEWIC 2012). Reproduction occurs year round and  size-at-hatch is 10.4â11.4 cm TL (Kulka et al. 2006). Females mature at 38.4â87.3 cm TL and males mature at 44â83 cm TL (McCully et al. 2012, Lynghammar et al. 2016). Two generation lengths were used to reflect the striking life history differences between the Northwest Atlantic (south) and elsewhere. Information on age-at-maturity is available for only two areas, in the  North Sea (Northeast Atlantic) age-at-maturity (Am) is 5.6 years (Walker 1998) and age-at-maturity is 11 years on the Scotian  Shelf (Northwest Atlantic, south) (McPhie and Campana 2009, Simon et al. 2012). From these studies, generation length is calculated as 10.6 years (North Sea, Northeast Atlantic) and 16 years  (Scotian ShelfNorthwest Atlantic, south), based on GL = Am + 1/M, assuming a natural rate of  mortality (M) of 0.2."," This species is known from 30 specimens taken from the Northeast Atlantic slope at depths of 1,014â1,800 m. It occurs on or near the bottom over upper to mid continental and insular slopes where the bottom temperature is 3.7â9.6Â°C and salinity is 35.1â34.9 ppm.    This catshark is relatively small and sluggish. The maximum reported size for the species is 54 cm total length (TL). Males and females are adolescent at 40 cm and 46 cm TL, and mature at 47 cm and 50 cm TL, respectively. It is an egg-laying species, but nothing else is known about reproduction (Nakaya and Stehmann 1998, Ebert and Stehmann 2013).  ","This species occurs on continental mid-slopes and seamounts at depths of 512â1,520 m, but generally > 1,000 m (IglÃ©sias et al. 2004, Nakaya et al. 2008). Known from depths of 900â1,275 m in the Southwest Pacific (Last and Stevens 2009).Â The maximum recorded size from the North Atlantic is 76.1 cm total length (TL; IglÃ©sias et al. 2004) and from Australia is about 79 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009). Males and females smaller than 47.3 cm TL are immature. Adolescent males are 54.8â57.7 cm TL and females are 57.6â59.9 cm TL. Mature males are >61.5 cm TL and females are >59.6 cm TL (Nakaya et al. 2008). Reproduction is presumably oviparous, like other Apristurus species, but very little is known of the biology.","The Pallid Skate has been recorded from the lower continental and insular slopes to the abyss at depths of 1,869â3,366 m (Last et al. 2016, Porteiro et al. 2017). It reaches a maximum size of at least 162 cm total length (TL) (Last et al. 2016). Nothing else is known of its biology.","This bathydemersal skate occurs on the continental slope, submarine rises, and deepwater plains at depths of 1,219â2,992 m (Ayling and Cox 1982, Ebert and Stehmann 2013). Richardson's Skate reaches aÂ maximum size of 174 cm total length (TL) (Templeman 1973). Size at birth is 18.2â24.5 cm TL. The species is oviparous like other skates but nothing more is known of its biology at present.","The Roughtail Stingray is demersal on soft bottoms, usually to 100 m depth but does occur to 275 m (Last et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 220 cm disc width (DW); females mature at 140â160 cm DW, males at 130â150 cm DW (Last et al. 2016). Reproduction is viviparous and females give birth to 2â6Â pups that are 34â37 cm DW (Last et al. 2016). Generation length is suspected to be about 21.5 years, based on data for the congener Brown Stingray (Bathytoshia lata), which has an age at maturity of 15 years and a maximum age of 28 years (Dale and Holland 2012).","The Copper Shark occurs in warm temperate and subtropical waters on the continental shelf from close inshore to depths of 145 m (Ebert et al. 2013a, Weigmann 2016). It also occurs in brackish or freshwater in the lower reaches of large rivers and estuarine bays, appears singly and in loose schools of hundreds of individuals, and has inshore nursery grounds (Cliff and Dudley 1992, Last 2002, Ebert et al. 2013a, Drew et al. 2019). It reaches a maximum size of 325 cm total length (TL), males mature at 200â255 cm TL and females mature at 215â270 cm TL, with regional variation in these parameters; size-at-maturity is smaller in Argentina than in South Africa and Australia (Cliff and Dudley 1992, Lucifora et al. 2005, Last and Stevens 2009, Drew et al. 2017). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta and litter sizes of 7â26, a likely biennial reproductive cycle, and size at birth of 59â70 cm (Ebert et al. 2013a, Drew et al. 2017). Female age-at-maturity is 16 years and maximum age is 31 years, resulting in a generation length of 23.5 years (Drew et al. 2017).","The Spinner Shark is coastal and pelagic in warm temperate and tropical waters on continental and insular shelves at depths of 0â200 m (Weigmann 2016). It  is a highly migratory species that occurs more frequently in inshore rather than offshore waters and has nursery grounds in shallow, near-shore waters (Ebert et al. 2013). The species is often found in schools that may include large numbers of individuals. It reaches a maximum size of 304 cm total length (Weigmann 2016), males mature at 170â220 cm TL and females mature at 160â222 cm TL with regional variation in these parameters; smaller sizes-at-maturity are noted for the North Atlantic and Arabian Seas and the larger sizes-at-maturity for Australia, Taiwan, and South Africa  (Branstetter 1987, Allen and Wintner 2002, Joung et al. 2005, Jabado and Ebert 2015, Geraghty et al. 2016). Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta and litter sizes of 3â15, a biennial reproductive cycle, and size-at-birth of 48â80 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009, Jabado and Ebert 2015, Joung et al. 2005). In Australia, verified female age-at-maturity is 8.5 years and maximum  age is 31 years, resulting in a generation length of 19.8 years (Geraghty et al.  2013, Geraghty et al. 2016). In the Gulf of Mexico, verified female  age-at-maturity is 7.6 years with a maximum age of 17.5 years, resulting in a  generation length of 12.6 years (Carlson and Baremore 2005). These Gulf of Mexico ages are  similar to estimated ages in a previous Gulf of Mexico study and to ages  estimated from South Africa (Branstetter 1987, Allen and Wintner 2002).","The Blacktip Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate seas on the continental shelf from close inshore to a depth of 140 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It mostly occurs close inshore including off river mouths, in estuaries, shallow muddy bays, mangroves, lagoons, and coral reef drop-offs (Ebert et al. 2013). It often occurs in large schools near the surface and has inshore nursery grounds (Hueter et al. 2007, Ebert et al. 2013, Kajiura and Tellman 2016, Amojil et al. 2018). The species reaches a maximum size of 286 cm total length (TL), males mature at 125â201 cm TL and females mature at 145â207 cm TL, with regional variation in these and age parameters; maximum size and size-at-maturity is smaller in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico than in the Indo-Pacific (Branstetter 1987, Dudley and Cliff 1993, Castro 1996, Carlson et al. 2006, White 2007, Tovar-Ãvila et al. 2009, Moore et al. 2012, Smart et al. 2015, Jabado et al. 2016, Harry et al. 2019). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta and litter sizes of 1â11, a biennial-triennial reproductive cycle (varies regionally), and size-at-birth of 38â72 cm (Dudley and Cliff 1993, Castro 1996, CapapÃ© et al. 2004, White 2007, Harry et al. 2019). In Australia and Indonesia, female age-at-maturity is 8.3 and 7.6 years and maximum age is 24 and 17 years; thus, generation length is 16.2 and 12.3 years, respectively (Smart et al. 2015, Harry et al. 2019). In South Africa, female age-at-maturity is 7 years and maximum age is 11 years, resulting in a generation length of 9 years (Winter and Cliff 1996). In the Gulf of Mexico and Northwest Atlantic, female age-at-maturity is 6.5 and 6.7 years and maximum age is 23.5 and 17.5 years; thus, generation length is 15.0 and 12.1 years, respectively (Carlson et al. 2006, Passerotti and Baremore 2012, Baremore and Passerotti 2013, Deacy et al. 2018, SEDAR 2020).","The Dusky Shark is coastal and pelagic throughout its range, where it   occurs from the surf zone to well offshore, and from the surface down to depths of 500 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 420 cm total length (TL); males mature at 265â280 cm TL, females mature at 257â310 cm TL (Simpfendorfer et al. 2002, McAuley et al. 2007, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 2â18, with a long gestation of 22 months, a two or three year reproductive cycle, and size-at-birth of 70â100 cm TL (Branstetter and Burgess 1996, Romine 2004, Dudley et al. 2005, McAuley et al.  2007). In the Northwest Atlantic, female-age-at maturity is 17.6 years and maximum age is 42 years based on bomb-radiocarbon validated ages; generation length is therefore 29.8 years (Natanson et al. 2014). Older ages were validated in Western Australia, Eastern Indian Ocean for female age-at-maturity of 27â32 years and maximum age of 40â53 years (Simpfendorfer et al. 2002, McAuley et al. 2005), indicative of a more conservative life history for the Indo-Pacific subpopulation; using the means of these age parameters, generation length is therefore 38 years. The estimate of intrinsic rates of population increase are low in the Indo-Pacific subpopulation, estimated from Western Australian stocks at about 0.025 per year in theÂ absenceÂ of fishing (McAuley et al. 2007).","The Sandbar Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical and temperate seas on the continental shelf from close inshore to a depth of 280 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It occurs in shallow waters associated with bays, estuaries and harbours and offshore on oceanic banks (Ebert et al. 2013). Some stocks make extensive seasonal migrations, such as those in the Northwest Atlantic and South Africa (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013). The species reaches a maximum size of ~240 cm total length (TL), possibly to 300 cm TL, with regional variation in size-at-maturity and age parameters; males mature at 123â180 cm TL and females mature at 129â190 cm TL (McAuley et al. 2007, Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta with variable litter sizes of 1â14 pups (5â12 common), a bienniel to triennial reproductive cycle (varies regionally) and size-at-birth of 40â76 cm TL (Cliff et al. 1988, Joung and Chen 1995, Hazin et al. 2007, McAuley et al. 2007, Baremore and Hale 2012, Geraghty et al. 2016). Female age-at-maturity ranges from 8 to 16 years and maximum observed age ranges from 21 to 27 years (Casey et al. 1985, Sminkey and Musick 1995, Joung et al. 2004, McAuley et al. 2006, Romine et al. 2006, Baremore and Hale 2012, Geraghty et al. 2013, Hale and Baremore 2013, Romine et al. 2013, Geraghty et al. 2016). In this assessment, age parameters are used from: (1) the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico where female age-at-maturity is 13.1 years and maximum age is 27 years resulting in a generation length of 20 years (Baremore and Hale 2012, Hale and Baremore 2013): and (2) Western Australia where female age-at-maturity is 16.2 years and maximum age is suggested as 36 years for females resulting in a generation length of 26 years (McAuley et al. 2006). The observed maximum age from Western Australia is 25 years, however based on maximum size, maximum age is estimated as 36 years which is likely more realistic based on inference from bomb radiocarbon and oxtetracycline validation (Andrews et al. 2011, Natanson et al. 2019).","The Sand Tiger Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical and temperate seas on the continental shelf from the surf zone to a depth of 232 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It occurs mainly in shallow waters of 15â25 m depth and aggregates in or near underwater caves, gullies, and rocky and coral reefs (Otway and Parker 2000, Pollard et al. 1996, Ebert et al. 2013, Momigliano and Jaiteh 2015). The species is philopatric and undertakes complex size- and sex-segregated migrations associated with seasonal and reproductive events, habitually returning to the same breeding area (Bass et al. 1975, Gilmore 1993, Musick et al. 1993, Otway and Ellis 2011, Bansemer and Bennett 2011). It reaches a maximum size of 325 cm total length (TL), males mature at 190â200 cm TL and females mature at 220â235 cm TL (Gilmore et al. 1993, Lucifora 2003, Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is adelphophagic viviparous with a litter size of 2 pups, a biennial reproductive cycle (possibly annual and triennial regionally), and a size-at-birth of 85â105 cm TL (Branstetter and Musick 1994, Henningsen et al. 2004, Gilmore et al. 2005, Dicken et al. 2006, Bansemer and Bennett 2009). Female age-at-maturity is estimated as 7.7 years in the Southwest Atlantic and 9â10 years in the Northwest Atlantic and maximum age is validated to at least 40 years in the Northwest Atlantic and Southwest Indian Oceans (Lucifora 2003, Passerotti et al. 2014, Jakobs and Braccini et al. 2019, S. Wintner pers. comm. 13 March 2020). Generation length is thus estimated as 24.8 years.","The White Shark is pelagic and most commonly occurs in temperate continental shelf waters but also ranges into estuaries and the open ocean, and occurs to depths of 1,200 m (Francis et al. 2012). Movement studies and DNA analyses have demonstrated that the White Shark undertakes long distance trans-oceanic movements, for example between South Africa and Australasia (Pardini et al. 2001, Bonfil et al. 2005), and California and the Hawaiian Islands (Boustany et al. 2002, Domeier and Nasby-Lucas 2008, Jorgensen et al. 2010). Consequently, its distribution is not considered disjunct, rather that interchange between some areas may be limited. The maximum size is undetermined, but estimated at 600â640 cm total length (TL) (Compagno 2001). Males mature at 310â410 cm TL (Pratt 1996, Compagno 2001, Tanaka et al. 2011); the majority of females mature at 400â500 cm TL (Francis 1996, Tanaka et al. 2011) but have been reported as immature at 472â490 cm TL (Springer 1939, Compagno 2001); and, size at birth is  120â150 cm TL (Francis 1996). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with oophagy and histrophy, with litter sizes of 2â17 and  a suspected two to three year reproductive cycle (Francis 1996, Uchida et al. 1996, Mollet and Cailliet 2002, Bruce 2008, Domeier 2012, Sato et al. 2016). In the Northwest Atlantic, Northeast Pacific, and Western Indian Oceans, female age-at-maturity of 30â33 years and maximum age ofÂ  30â73 years were reported based on bomb radiocarbon validated ages (HamadyÂ et al.Â 2014, Andrews and Kerr 2015, Natanson and Skomal 2015,Â Christiansen et al. 2016). Due to the accurate method of bomb radiocarbon ageing, these are possibly more accurate than the previous lower estimates of female age-at-maturity of 7â15 years and maximum ages of 18â30 years (Cailliet et al. 1985, Wintner and Cliff 1999, Bruce 2008, Tanaka et al. 2011, Hillary et al. 2018). Using the precautionary approach and the validated, most conservative bomb radiocarbon ages of age-at-maturity of 33 years and maximum age of 73 years, generation length is 53 years. The bomb radiocarbon maximum age is accepted as being likely  >30 years, minimum of 44 years, and possibly maximum of 73 years. The  female age-at-maturity is possibly more contentious and to explore the sensitivity of the global population trend analyses to the younger female age-at-maturity, estimates of female age-at-maturity of 15 years and maximum age of 44 years were also used, that led to a generation length of 29.5 years (see Population section).","The Gulper SharkÂ is demersal and benthopelagic on continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of 98â1,500 m (possibly down to 2,307 m), and mostly 300â1,100 m (White et al. 2013, Weigmann, 2016, C. Cotton unpubl. data 2019). It reaches a maximum size of 176 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~111 cm TL; females at ~143 cm TL (Cotton et al. 2015, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 1â7, and mostly 4â6Â (White et al. 2013, Cotton et al. 2015).Â Maximum age and age-at-maturity are unknown for this species and were inferred from a congener gulper shark species (Centrophorus granulosus), which has aÂ female age-at-maturity of 16.5 years andÂ a maximum age of 39 years (Guallart 1998).Â This results in a generation length of 27.75 years.Â ","The Leafscale Gulper Shark is demersal on continental and insular shelves and slopes to the abyss at depths of 0â3,366 m, and mostly at depths >200 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 166 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~100â110 cm TL and females mature at ~110â125 cm TL (EbertÂ et al. 2013a, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 5â8 pups and size-at-birth is 30â40 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013a). There are regional differences in age parameters. In the Northeast Atlantic, female age-at-maturity is 35 years and maximum age is 70 (ClarkeÂ et al. 2005), resulting in a generation length of 52.5 years. In the Southwest Pacific, female age-at-maturity is 20.8 years and maximum age is 42, resulting in a generation length of 31.4 years (Parker and Francis 2012).","The Little Gulper SharkÂ is demersal on continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of 50â1,400 m, and mostly between 400â800 m (Weigmann 2016, C. Cotton, unpubl. data).Â Tracking data shows that in Australia at least this species has a restricted and narrow distribution and is mainly restricted to the upper continental slope between the 300â700 m bathymetric contours near the seafloor (Daley et al 2015). It reaches a maximum size of 128 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~80 cm TL and females mature at ~96 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013).Â Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, fecundity is very low, with a single pup per litter, and size-at-birth estimated at 35â45 cm TL (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013).Â Generation length of this species is estimated at 60 years (B. Moe, pers. comm., 21/11/2019), but should be used with caution as further validation is required.Â ","The Black Dogfish is demersal on the outer continental shelf and slope at depths of 180â2,250 m (Ebert et al. 2013). The largest reported size off Canada is 92 cm total length (TL) (D.W. Kulka unpubl. data 2019), although it reportedly reaches 107 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Females mature atÂ 46â69 cm TL and males at 46â59 cm TL (Yano 1995, EbertÂ et al.Â 2013, Hedeholm et al. 2019). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparity with litter sizes of 4â40 with mean of 16.4, with an annual or biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 15â20 cm TL (Yano 1995, Ebert and Stehmann 2013). Female age-at-maturity is 27 years and maximum observed age was conservatively estimated to be 38, therefore the generation length is estimated to be at least 32.5 years (Qvist 2017). Eye lens radiocarbon dating suggests that the largest individuals were at least 50 years old (Qvist 2017).","The Portuguese Dogfish is demersal on the continental slope at depths of 128â3,675 m, with most records at depths >400 m (Ebert et al. 2013) and peak abundance occurring at depths > 1,000 m (Neat et al. 2015). It reaches a maximum size of 137 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~85â100 cm TL and females mature at 95â110 cm TL (EbertÂ et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 1â29 pups, mostly 12â14,Â and size-at-birth is 25â35 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013).Â Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a related species, the Longnose Velvet Dogfish (Centroselachus crepidater) that has a female age-at-maturity of 20 years and a maximum age of 54 years, resulting in a generation length of 37 years (Irvine et al. 2006).","The Longnose Velvet Dogfish is demersal on the continental slope at depths of 200â2,080 m, and mostly at depths >500 m (Ebert et al. 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 105 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~60â68 cm TL and females mature at ~77â88 cm TL (EbertÂ et al. 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 1â9 pups and size-at-birth is 28â35 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Female age at maturity is 20 years and maximum age is 54 (Irvine et al. 2006), resulting in a generation length of 37 years.","The Basking Shark is a planktivorous coastal-pelagic species named for its habit of swimming slowly at the surface but it also vertical migrates to depths of 1,264 m (Gore et al. 2008). It occurs in temperate and tropical waters, but in temperate waters it is present near the surface and in tropical and equatorial waters, it occurs deeper, below the thermocline (Ebert et al. 2013, Dewar et al. 2018). It is the second largest shark after the Whale Shark (Rhincodon typus)  and reaches a maximum estimated size of 1,276â1,973 cm total length  (TL) (Parker and Stott 1965, Holden 1974, Weigmann 2016). The species  aggregates in coastal waters, with aggregations of up to 1,398  individuals observed in the northeast United States, and it also undertakes large-scale  migrations (Gore et al. 2008, Skomal et al. 2009, Witt et al. 2014, Doherty et al. 2017, Crowe et al. 2018, Dewar et al.  2018). Males mature at 400â750 cm TL, females mature at 690â980 cm  TL, and size at birth is estimated at 150â200 cm TL (Matthews and Parker  1950, Parker and  Stott 1965, Pauly  1978, Compagno 1984, SimsÂ et al. 1997,Â Fowler 2005, Ebert et al. 2013,  Francis 2017). Reproduction is viviparous and oophagous with an  estimated gestation of 12â36 months and a likely resting period of two  years between litters (Parker and Stott 1965, Pauly 1978, 2002; Compagno 1984). Only one litter of 6 near-term pups has been reported  (Sund 1943). Female age-at-maturity is estimated at 16â20 years (18  years average) and maximum age is estimated at 50 years; generation  length is therefore 34 years (Compagno 1984, Pauly 2002, Fowler 2005).  Annual rate of population increase is estimated at 0.013â0.023 and  natural mortality is low at M = ~0.07 per year (Pauly 2002,  Fowler 2005).","Rabbitfish have been recorded on the continental slope at depths of 200â1,663 m, but usually 200â700 m (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm total length (TL)/ ~50 cm body length (BDL). Maturity occurs at ~41 cm pre-supracaudal fin length (PSCFL) and ~46 cm PSCFL in males and females, respectively (Moura et al. 2004). Like other chimaeras, it is oviparous, and appears to have spawning seasons in spring and summer. Ovarian fecundity was estimated at ~6.5 per breeding cycle (MouraÂ et al.Â 2004).  Maximum age estimates observed were 30 years for males and 26 years for females, although these ages are likely an underestimation given the small sample size (Calis et al. 2005). Estimated age-at-first-maturity was 13.4 and 11.2 years for males and females, respectively (Calis et al. 2005). The generation length of this species is calculated at 21.7 years.","The Opal Chimaera has been recorded from the continental slope and seamounts at depths of 800â1,975 m (Vieria and Cunha 2014, FreitasÂ et al.Â 2017). It reaches a maximum size of at least 110 cm total length (TL)/~63 cm body length (BDL) (LuchettiÂ et al. 2011). Maturity is estimated ~95 cm TL and ~92 cm TL for males and females, respectively (LuchettiÂ et al. 2011). Like other chimaeras, it is oviparous.","The Frilled Shark is demersal or benthopelagic,Â on the outer continental and insular shelves, and is reported as occasionally pelagic over the upper and middle continental slope. This speciesÂ ranges from depths of 20 to 1,500 m, but is most typically found between 500 and 1,000 m depthÂ (Compagno 1984, Last and Stevens 2009, EbertÂ et al. 2013).Â This species is viviparous, and likely matrotrophic with a probable gestation period of 1â2 years; young are born 39 to 60 cm total length (TL) and 2 to 15 pups are produced per litter,Â which are nourished by large uterine eggs (11â12 cm diameter); size at maturity is estimated to be 92â163 cm TL for males, and 130â135 cm TL for females; maximum size, known only for females, is approximately 196 cm TL (Gudger and Smith 1933, Tanaka et al. 1990, Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013). A single trawl off the mid-Atlantic Ridge to the north of the Azores retained 34 Frilled Sharks (15 males and 19 females) in December 2003; it is suspected that this trawl took place during a mating event (Kukueva and Pavlov 2008).","The Kitefin Shark is a deepwater, benthic to mesopelagic species, recorded on continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths from 37-1,800 m, but mainly >200 m (Ebert et al. 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 182 cm total length (TL); males mature ~100 cm TL; females mature ~120 cm TL; size at birth 30-40 cm TL. Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous; presumably asynchronous; and litter size is 3-16 pups (average 6-8) (Daley et al. 2002, Ebert et al. 2013). Generation length is estimated to be 29 years (estimated from age data from Deania in Irvine et al. 2012).","The Common Stingray is demersal on sandy and muddy substrates on the continental shelf at depths of 0â200 m,Â but is more commonly found in shallow waters less than 50 mÂ (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016,Â LastÂ et al.Â 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 140 cm disc width (DW), males mature at 26â31 cm DW and females mature at 28â41 cm DW (Ismen 2003, Carpenter and De Angelis 2016,Â LastÂ et al.Â 2016).Â Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 3â9 pups, a gestation length of 4Â months, and size-at-birth ofÂ ~Â 8â12 cm DW (Ismen 2003, Ebert and Stehmann 2013,Â LastÂ et al.Â 2016).Â The Common Stingray has an age-at-maturity of 7 years and a maximum age of 16 years; resulting in a generation length of 7.5 years (Yigin and Ismen 2012).","Tortonese's Stingray occurs in coastal and estuarine areas from the surface to a depth of 100 m (Last et al. 2016b). It reaches a maximum size of 84 cm disc width (DW), males mature at 33â38 cm DW, females mature at 33â47 cm DW,Â and size-at-birth isÂ ~15â16 cm DW (LastÂ et al.Â 2016b, Saadaoui et al. 2016). Little else is known of its biology.","The Birdbeak Dogfish occurs on continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of 60â1,600 m, with most individuals recorded at depths >400 m (Neat et al. 2015, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 162 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 73â94 cm TL and females mature at 94â106 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter size of 6â12 pups andÂ size-at-birth isÂ 28â34 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013).Â There are slight regional differences in age parameters. In the Northeast Atlantic, female age-at-maturity is 25 years and maximum age is 35 years; resulting in a generation length of 30 years (Clarke et al. 2002). In the Southwest Pacific, female age-at-maturity is 21.5 years and maximum age is 37 years; resulting in a generation length of 29.25 years (Irvine et al. 2012).","The Common Blue Skate is demersal in shallow coastal waters at depths of 10â600 m in continental shelf slope habitats and deep offshore seamounts/banks, although it is primarily within the 200 m depth range (Last et al. 2016, Weigmann 2016). This is a large species of skate and reaches a maximum size of at least 143 cm total length (TL), males mature at ~115 cm TL and females mature at 123 cm TL (Last et al. 2016). Reproduction is oviparous with ~40 egg-cases deposited annually and size-at-birth of 21â22 cm TL (Clark 1922, 1926; Ebert and Dando 2021). The age and growth of the âcommon skate complexâ was reported by Du Buit (1976) and more recently by Fahy (1991) who examined the vertebrae of 75 individuals landed in Ireland. Using the age-at-length relationship determined for the âcommon skate complexâ (Du Buit 1976), the age at 50% maturity is tentatively suggested as 11 years for Common Blue Skate and maximum age is estimated as 30 years. Thus, generation length is estimated as 20 years.","The Flapper Skate is demersal on the continental shelf and slope to at depths of 20â1,500 m, although it is primarily within the 200 m depth range (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, Last et al. 2016). This is the largest species of skate attaining a length of at least 254 cm total length (TL), males mature at ~185 cm TL and females mature at ~197 cm TL (Last et al. 2016). Reproduction oviparous and size-at-birth is 21â29 cm TL (Clark 1926, IglÃ©sias et al. 2010, Last et al. 2016). The age and growth of the âcommon skate complexâ was reported by Du Buit (1976) and more recently by Fahy (1991) who examined the vertebrae of 75 individuals landed in Ireland. Using the age-at-length relationship determined for the âcommon skate complexâ (Du Buit 1976), the age at 50% maturity is tentatively suggested as 19â20 years for Flapper Skate and maximum age is estimated at up to 50 years. Thus, the generation length is estimated as 34.5 years.","This benthic and benthopelagic species is found on slopes and submarine rises at 200 m to > 1,000 m depth (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, Stehmann 1990), but little is known about its biology. This is one of the largest European skates with a maximum total length of at least 230 cm (Ebert and Stehman 2013). Like other skates, it is an egg-laying species.

This egg laying skate has a spawning period from February to May (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, Bauchot 1987, Notarbartolo di Sciara and Bianchi 1998, Serena et al. 2010), and produces egg cases between 10 and 15 cm in length. Size at birth is 17 cm total length (TL; Ebert and Stehmann 2013). Estimated length at 50% maturity was 83.2 cm TL for males and 104.4 cm TL for females (Serena et al. 2011). Both sexes are estimated to reach sexual maturity between six and eight years. Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel (1984) reported a maximum size of 150 cm TL. The generation length of this species is inferred from that of Barndoor Skate (which is slightly larger) to be around 10 years.","This demersal skate is found on sandy or muddy bottoms at depths ranging from 90â900 m, and appears to be most abundant from 200â500 m (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, Baino et al. 2001).

It reaches a maximum size of 96 cm total length (TL) (Dyb and Bergstad 2004); females mature at 62 cm TL and males at 57 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparity and females give birth annually to 11 pups that are 12â17 cm TL (Castro 2010, Ebert and Stehmann 2013, Cotton et al. 2015). Female age at maturity is suspected to be 15 years and maximum age is 27 years; generation length is therefore estimated to be 21 years (C.F. Cotton unpubl. data 2019).","The Smooth Lanternshark has been recorded from continental and insular slopes at depths of 0â1,120 m, and possibly as deep as 1,998 m; it has also been recorded as epipelagic and mesopelagic over deep waterÂ (Ebert et al. 2013).Â It reaches a maximum size of 50.2 cm total length (TL) (Ebert et al. 2013); males mature at ~38Â cm TL and females mature at ~44 cm TL (Coelho and Erzini 2007).

Female age-at-maturity is 4.7 years and maximum age is 11 years, resulting in a generation length of 7.8 years (Coelho and Erzini 2008). ","The Tiger Shark inhabits shelf, reef, and slope habitats, is sometimes associated with coral reefs, and occasionally makes longer-distance excursions into the pelagic zone. The species mostly occurs to 100 m depth but also dives to depths greater than 1,000 m (1,136 m maximum recorded) and has been noted to move hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of kilometres (Holmes et al. 2014, Werry et al. 2014, Afonso and Hazin 2015, Lea et al. 2015).The species has a higher intrinsic rate of population increase than many other carcharhinid sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). Growth rates during early life stages are thought to be high (Branstetter et al. 1987). Maximum recorded size is 740 cm total length (TL) but individuals larger than 500 cm TL are rarely seen (Ebert et al. 2013). There is regional variability in sizes and ages at maturity with females mature at 274-345 cm TL and males at 250-305 cm TL (Compagno 1984, Randall 1992, Simpfendorfer 1992, Wintner and Dudley 2000, Whitney and Crow 2007, Holmes et al. 2015). The maximum age is estimated at 27-37 years (Natanson et al. 1999, Kneebone et al. 2008, Holmes et al. 2015), with age at maturity of 4-13 years (Branstetter et al. 1987, Smith et al. 1998, Natanson et al. 1999, Afonso et al. 2012, Meyer et al. 2014, Holmes et al. 2015). Based on data from the Western North Atlantic (Natanson et al. 1999) and Australia (Holmes et al. 2015), the generation length is estimated at 17.5-22.5 years.The Tiger Shark is the only species of the family Carcharhinidae that is lecithotrophic viviparous. Litter sizes are large, with a maximum of 82 embryos records and an average litter size of 26-33 pups (Tester 1969, Bass et al. 1975, Simpfendorfer 1992). The size at birth is 51-90 cm TL (Randall 1992, Simpfendorfer 1992). Gestation is approximately 15-16 months with a triennial reproductive cycle in Hawaii and Australia (Whitney and Crow 2007, Holmes 2015).   ","Tope is bentho-pelagic in temperate waters on continental and insular shelves and upper to mid slopes from shallow inshore to well offshore to depths of 826 m, though it most frequently occurs to depths of 200 m (Walker et al. 2006, Wiegmann 2016, Thorburn et al. 2019). Some large individuals travel long oceanic distances offshore well away from the continental shelves and slopes, but they do not cross ocean basins (Walker 1999, Walker et al. 2008, Colloca et al. 2019). Tope sometimes moves diurnally from shallow water at night to deep water by day, and usually occurs in schools, partially segregated by size and sex (Walker et al. 2008). The species has pupping and nursery areas in shallow, protected bays and estuaries where the young can remain for up to two years (Stevens and West 1997, Walker 1999, Walker et al. 2006, Bovcon 2018, McMillan et al. 2018).The maximum size varies regionally with the largest maximum size of 200 cm total length (TL) in the Mediterranean Sea (CapapÃ© and Mellinger 1998) and the smallest maximum size of 155 cm TL in the Southwest Atlantic (Peres and Vooren 1991). There is also regional variation in size-at-maturity: males mature at 107â170 cm TL and females mature at 118â185 cm TL (Walker et al. 2006, Ebert 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes 6â52 (average 20â35), a reproductive cycle that reportedly varies regionally from annual to triennial, although studies with intensive sampling indicate triennial cycles, and a gestation period of ~12 months and size-at-birth that varies regionally from 26â40 cm TL (Peres and Vooren 1991, Walker 1999, Walker 2005, Ebert et al. 2013). Female age-at-maturity varies from 10â15 years (average 12.5 years) and maximum age is estimated as 40 years (tag returns suggest a possible maximum age of 60 years); generation length is therefore 26.3 years (Olsen 1954, Ferriera and Vooren 1991, Freer 1992, Francis and Mulligan 1998, Walker 1999).","The Blackmouth Catshark is demersal on the outer continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 55â2,000 m, and mostly at 200â500 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum length of 90 cm total length (TL), males mature 34â42 m TL and females mature at 39â45 cm TL (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013). Reproduction is oviparous and fecundity is up to 13 egg cases per litter. Maximum age and age-at-maturity are unknown; maximum age is inferred from a congener, the Blacktip Sawtail Catshark (Galeus sauteri), with female age-at-maturity of 9.1 years and a maximum age of 20.9 yearsÂ (LiuÂ et al.Â 2011). This results in a generation length of 15 years. Preliminary ageing work suggests the Blackmouth Catshark may have similar age and growth parametersÂ (BaptistaÂ et al.Â 2010)Â so a generation length of 15 years is used here. This generation length should be used with caution since validated age and growth data are unavailable.","The Atlantic Nurse Shark inhabits rocky and coral reefs, seagrasses, mangrove channels, and sand flats on tropical and subtropical continental and insular shelves from inshore to a depth of 130 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016), but only to a depth of 60 m in the Gulf of Mexico (J.K. Carlson unpubl. data 2020). Individuals have small home ranges, these sharks tend to aggregate together, and they are typically nocturnal. It reaches a maximum size of 308 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016); males mature at 210 cm TL and females mature at 230â240 cm TL. Reproduction is viviparous, and females give birth every other year in late spring and summer to 20â30 pups per litter after a 5â6 month gestation (Ebert et al. 2013). Female age-at-maturity is 25 years and longevity is about 35 years, therefore generation length is estimated at about 30 years (Carrier and Luer 1990).","The Blackchin Guitarfish occurs from close inshore to depths of at least 80 m on the continental shelf (Last et al. 2016b). It occurs on sandy and muddy substrates. Maximum size is 265 cm total length (TL); size at maturity varies between the Eastern Atlantic (Senegal; males mature at 155 cm TL; females mature at 163 cm TL; Seck et al. 2004), and the Mediterranean (Tunisia; males mature at 100-112 cm TL; females mature at 110â138 cm TL;Â CapapÃ© and Zaouali 1994, Enajjar et al. 2012).Â Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 5-12 (Tunisia) and 16â24 (Senegal) pups with an annual reproductive cycle; size at birth is ~34 cm TL (CapapÃ© and Zaouali 1994,Â SeckÂ et al.Â 2004, LastÂ et al.Â 2016b). Age at maturity is 2.9 years in males and 5.1 years in females; maximum age is 14 years (198 cm TL female) (EnajjarÂ et al.Â 2012) but is likely higher given the species reaches a larger maximum size. Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information).","The Spiny Butterfly Ray occurs in shallow coastal waters, including the intertidal zone, over sand and mud habitats to a depth of 150 m, but more typically in depths of less than 50 m (Last et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of ~260 cm disc width (DW); males mature at 78â130 cm DW, females mature at 102â108 cm DW (Last et al. 2016). Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous and litter size varies geographically but generally 1â8 pups are produced annually after a 4â9 month gestation period and size-at-birth is estimated at 38â44 cm DW (Last et al. 2016). Female age-at-maturity is around 4 years and maximum age is 18 years resulting in a generation length of 11 years (Parsons et al. 2018).","This deepwater species primarily occurs over continental slopes at depths of 350â2,600 m (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert and Stehmann 2013). It has been observed with remote operated vehicles over soft mud and gravelly bottom substrates and sometimes in association with other deepwater chimaeroids (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). Similar to many other chimaeroids, adults and juveniles may occupy different habitats and an ontogenetic shift in depth occurs with large individuals occurring deeper than smaller individuals (Ebert and Stehmann 2013).Females grow larger than males. The maximum recorded size is 70 cm precaudal length; size at maturity for males is ~25â30 cm body length (BDL) and for females, it is Â ~30 cm BDL; size at birth is ~10â13 cm precaudal length (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). Little is known about the spawning and reproduction of this egg-laying species, other than it has a small egg case around 16 cm in length (Ebert and Stehmann 2013).Â ","The Sharpnose SevengillÂ Shark occurs in tropical and temperate benthopelagic watersÂ off the continental and insular shelf and upper slope at depths of 0â1,000, but mostly 27â720 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann, 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 140 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~70â80 cm TL and females at 100 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann, 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 6â20, and size-at-birth is estimated at 26â30 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Maximum age and age-at-maturity are unknown; maximum age is inferred from a congener, the Bluntnose Sixgill SharkÂ (Hexanchus griseus), with female age-at-maturity is estimated at 26.5 years andÂ a maximum age of 80 years (COSEWIC 2007). This results in a generation length of 53 years. TheÂ Bluntnose Sixgill SharkÂ is larger thanÂ Bigeyed SixgillÂ SharkÂ (550 cm vs 140 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 13.5 years forÂ Bigeyed SixgillÂ Shark.","The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark isÂ demersal in tropical, temperate and boreal waters on the slope, shelf, and occasionally inshore at depths of 0â2,490 m, but mostly 200â1,100 mÂ (Ebert et al. 2013, Griffing et al. 2014, Weigmann 2016).Â It also occurs on seamounts and mid-ocean ridges and is often associated areas of high biological productivity and upwelling (Ebert et al. 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 550 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016); males mature at ~309â330 cm TL and females mature at 350â420 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013).Â Reproduction is aplacental viviparousÂ with litter sizes of 47â108, and size-at-birth is estimated at 61â74 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Female age-at-maturity is estimated at 26.5 years and maximum age is estimated at 80 years (COSEWIC 2007), resulting in a generation length of 53 years. This study has not been validated and estimates should be used with caution.Â ","The Small-eyed Rabbitfish has been recorded on the continental slope, ridges, seamounts,Â and abyssal plains at depths of 300â2,453 m, and is most common >1,000 m (Ebert and Stehmann 2013, Jamieson et al. 2017). It reaches a maximum size of at least 147 cm total length (TL)/96 cm body length (BDL). Maturity occurs at 66 cm body length (BDL) and ~68 cm BDL for males and females, respectively (Dagit and Clarke 2007). Like other chimaeras, it is oviparous.","The Large-eyed Rabbitfish has been recorded from the continental slope at depths of 450â1,933 m, generally below 800 m (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). It reaches a maximum size of at least 80 cm total length (TL)/35 cm body length (BDL). Nothing else known of its biology, but like other chimaeras, it is oviparous.","The Shortfin Mako is a neritic and oceanic, epipelagic and mesopelagic species, found worldwide in tropical and warm-temperate seas to depths of 888 m (Abascal et al. 2011, Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016).Â The species reaches a maximum size of about 445  cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 166â204 cm TL and females at 265â312 cm TL (Pratt and Casey 1983,  Stevens 1983, CliffÂ et al.Â 1990, Francis and Duffy 2005, Varghese et al. 2017). Reproduction is viviparous and oophagous with an estimated gestation period of 15â18  months and a three-year reproductive cycle (Mollet and Cailliet 2002). Litter size is 4â25 pups (possibly up to 30, mostly 10â18) with a size at birth of 60â70 cm TL (Garrick 1967, Compagno 2001). Female age at maturity varies from 18â21 years and maximum age from 28â32 years in New Zealand, the Southwest Pacific, Southwest Atlantic, and Northwest Atlantic Oceans; generation length is therefore 24â25 years (Bishop et al. 2006, Natanson et al. 2006, Wells et al. 2013, DoÃ±o et al. 2014, Barreto et al. 2016b).","The Porbeagle occurs inshore and over continental shelves, shelf edges, offshore banks, and in the open ocean to depths of 1,809 m (Francis et al. 2008, Reyes and Torres-Florez 2009, Weigmann 2016). It prefers cold, temperate waters below 18Â°C (Campana and Joyce 2004, Francis et al. 2008, Skomal et al. 2009). It reaches a maximum size of 357 cm total length (TL), though maximum size is likely larger in the North Atlantic as individuals >230 cm TL are rare in the Southwest Pacific (Francis et al. 2008). Males mature at 140â165 cm TL in the Southern Hemisphere and 155â177 cm TL in the North Atlantic, females mature at about 170â195 cm TL in the Southern Hemisphere and 200â219 cm TL in the North Atlantic (Jensen et al. 2002, Natanson et al. 2002, Francis and Duffy 2005, Francis et al. 2008, Forselledo 2012). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous and oophagous with litters of 1â5 (usually 4), with a 8â9 month gestation period, an annual, but possibly biennial, reproductive cycle, and size at birth of 68â78 cm TL (Francis and Stevens  2000, Francis et al. 2008, Ebert et al. 2013). Regional differences in bomb radiocarbon validated age estimates are apparent from the Northwest Atlantic and Southwest Pacific. Female age at maturity is 13 and 16.5 years and maximum age is 26 and 60 years; generation length is therefore 19.5 and 38.3 years, respectively (Campana et al. 2002, Francis et al. 2007, Francis 2015). Population growth rate is low but is countered by high juvenile survival rates to produce an overall moderate population growth rate in the North Atlantic of 0.052â0.081 (Dulvy et al. 2008, CortÃ©s et al. 2015).","This benthic skate occurs in offshore shelf waters and on upper slopes from 50â800 m depth. Historically it was found around 100 m depth on sandy and muddy bottoms, although it now seems more abundant in deeper waters where habitat preferences are currently unknown.  This species is oviparous with egg cases 88â90 by 50â60 mm (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, Mnsari et al. 2009). The spawning period is unknown (Bauchot 1987, Notarbartolo di Sciara and Bianchi 1998). Maximum recorded size is 120 cm total length (TL), but most individuals caught are between 70 and 80 cm TL (Serena 2005, Ebert and Stehmann 2013). Age at maturity, longevity, size at birth, reproductive age, gestation time, reproductive periodicity, fecundity, rate of population increase and natural mortality are unknown. Its congener L. naevus has a generation lengh of 9.7 years based on a longevity of 12 years, and an estimated age at maturity of 6.8-7.4 years. Thus, the generation length of L. circularis is also 9.7 years.","This benthic skate is found in offshore shelf and upper slope waters on sandy and coarse bottoms, predominantly found around 200 m depth but ranging from 30â800 m (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, Ellis et al. 2005). In the Mediterranean Sea, it occurs in relatively cold coastal waters and on upper parts of continental slopes in about 30â550 m, but has also been captured in deeper water down to 800 m (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1987, Bertrand et al. 2000, Baino et al. 2001).   Little is known about the biology and reproductive cycle of this relatively large-bodied skate. It is an egg laying species, producing egg cases that measure about 8 by 5 cm (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984). Specimens caught in the Celtic Seas and North Sea between 1992 and 2011 ranged from 21 to 96 cm and 24 to 70 cm total length (TL) in males and females, respectively (McCully et al. 2012). All female specimens were immature, while only two males at 75 and 96 cm TL were mature. The largest immature male caught was 82 cm TL. This species reaches a maximum size of 100â110 cm (Bauchot 1987). Based on the information available for its congener, L. naevus, the species has an estimated generation length of 9.7 years.","The species is found on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 20-500 m, and more commonly at about 200 m in the Mediterranean Sea (Serena 2005). It is typically an offshore species, occurring further offshore than, for example, Spotted Skate (Raja montagui) and Thornback Skate (Raja clavata). It is abundant on coarse sand and gravel substrates in the Irish Sea and western English Channel.   The size at maturity is estimated at 55 cm total length (TL) for both males and females (Walker 1999) with a maximum size of about 72 cm TL (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, Ellis et al. 2005). In the Mediterranean Sea, the maximum size recorded is about 70 cm TL and size at first maturity is 60 cm TL in females (Serena 2005). Age at maturity for females and males is estimated at 7.4 and 6.8 years, respectively, in the North Sea (Walker 1999), and age at 50% maturity is just over four years in the Irish Sea (Gallagher et al. 2005). Around the British Isles, males and females first mature at 48 and 45 cm TL, respectively (McCully et al. 2012). Additionally, length at 50% maturity (LÂ­Â­50) is estimated as 56.3 cm (males) and 59.4 cm (females). There is a significant difference in the LÂ­Â­50 for both sexes between the North Sea and Celtic Seas ecoregions, with females and males in the North Sea 6.2 to 6.5 cm smaller at this stage than in the Celtic Seas. The estimated LÂ­Â­50 in Portuguese waters is 56.5 and 56 cm TL for females and males, respectively (Maia et al. 2012). Longevity is reported at 12 years (Du Buit 1976b), which in conjunction with an age at 50% maturity of four years would indicate a generation time of eight years for individuals in the Irish Sea.   In Portuguese waters, actively spawning females and males can be found throughout the year, though the percentage of actively spawning individuals is higher between January and May (Maia et al. 2012). The maximum potential fecundity is estimated between 60 and 63 mature follicles for spawning-capable and actively spawning females, respectively. Batch fecundity was estimated as seven follicles per batch, with nine reproductive episodes per female. Other studies have indicated that females produce about 90 eggs per year after an eight month gestation period (Clark 1922, Du Buit 1976a, Bauchot 1987).","The Goblin Shark is recorded on outer continental shelves, upper slopes and off seamounts at depths of 0-1,300 m, but has been reported mainly at depths between 270-960 mÂ (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013). It also appears to be mesopelagic. Maximum measured size is 410 cm total length (TL) (Kukuev 1982), however, estimates from photographs ofÂ a specimen taken in the Gulf of MexicoÂ suggestÂ 540-617 cm TL (ParsonsÂ et al. 2002). Males mature between 260-380 cm TL; female maturity >400 cm TL; size at birth 80-90 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Pregnant females are unknown but like other lamniform sharks, the embryos are probably oviphagous and litter size is likely to be small. Nothing else is known about its biology.Â ","The Spinetail Devil Ray is a pelagic species that resides in coastal and continental shelf waters. It spends the majority of its time in less than 50 m of water but occasionally dives to depths of 1,112 m (Canese et al. 2011, Croll et al. 2012, Holcer et al. 2013, Francis and Jones 2017). The species exhibits large-scale movements, up to 1,800 km at minimum speeds of 63 km per day likely driven by seasonal patterns in prey availability  (Freund et al. 2000, Canese et al. 2011, Croll et al. 2012, Francis and Jones 2017). The species reaches a maximum size of 350 cm DW (Notarbartolo di Sciara et al. 2020), with significant geographical variation in size across its  distribution. Males mature at 200â220 cm disc width (DW) and females  mature at 215â240 cm disc width (DW). Reproduction is aplacental  matrotrophic with a gestation period of 12 months, and generally a single large pup (though two per litter occur occasionally) of 90â160 cm  DW. The reproductive cycle is 1â3 years, with resting periods between pregnancies in some years (White et al. 2006, Last et al. 2016, Rambahiniarison et al. 2018, Stevens et al. 2018). Female age-at-maturity is estimated as 5â6 years and maximum age estimated as 20 years (Cuevas-ZimbrÃ³n et al. 2013, Pardo et al. 2016); generation length is therefore 12.8 years.","TheÂ Starry SmoothhoundÂ is demersal onÂ sandy and gravelly substrates on theÂ innerÂ continental shelfÂ from the surface to a depth of 199 mÂ (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size ofÂ 140Â cm total length (TL), males mature atÂ 72 cm TL and females mature at 83 cm TL (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with aÂ biennial reproductive cycle,Â litter sizes ofÂ 6â18 pups, and a size-at-birth ofÂ 28Â cm TLÂ (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013). Female age-at-maturity isÂ 6Â years and maximum age isÂ 20Â years; generation length is thereforeÂ 13Â years (FarrellÂ et al.Â 2010a,b). The natural mortality rate of this species in the Northeast Atlantic was estimated at 0.219 per year and the intrinsic rate of population increase at 0.079 per year (Dureuil 2013).Â ","The Common Smoothhound occurs on sandy and muddyÂ substrates on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 5â438 m, but is more commonly found in shallow waters from 5â50 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Carpenter and De Angelis 2016, Pascual-AlayonÂ et al.Â 2017). It reaches a maximum size of 176 cm total length (TL),Â males mature at 70â112 cm TL and females mature at 107â124 cm TL (da Silva 2018, SaÃ¯diÂ et al.Â 2008,Â Carpenter and De Angelis 2016).Â Reproduction is placentotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 1â25 pups, a gestation period of 7â12 months, and size-at-birth of 24â45 cm TL (da Silva 2018, SaÃ¯diÂ et al.Â 2008,Â Carpenter and De Angelis 2016).Â The Common Smoothhound has an age-at-maturity of 10.75 years and a maximum age of 25 years, resulting in a generation length of 17.8 years (Goosen and Smale 1997, da Silva 2007).","The Blackspotted Smoothhound is demersal on the continental shelf and slope on sandy and gravelly substrates and sea grass beds, from the surface to a depth of 300 m (Ebert et al. 2013, SerenaÂ et al. 2014). It reaches a maximum size of 122 cm total length (TL), males mature at 81cm TL and females mature at 96 cm TL (SaÃ¯diÂ et al.Â 2009). Reproduction is placental viviparous with a uterine fecundity of 12â27, an annual reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 25 cm TL (SaÃ¯diÂ et al.Â 2009). The generation length is inferred from a regional congener Common Smoothhound (Mustelus mustelus) to be 18 years (Goosen and Smale 1997, da Silva 2007).","The Common Eagle Ray is demersal and semi-pelagic in shallow coastal waters on the continental shelf and offshore toÂ aÂ depth ofÂ 537 m and often swims in groups (WhiteheadÂ et al.Â 1984,Â LastÂ et al.Â 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm disc width (DW) with males mature at ~32â40 cm DW and females mature at ~43â60 cm DW (LastÂ et al.Â 2016). Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous with a gestation period of 6â8 months, litter sizes of 3â7 pups, and size-at-birth at ~19 cm DW (WhiteheadÂ et al.Â 1984,Â LastÂ et al.Â 2016). There is no information on this species's age-at-maturity and maximum age, hence, generation length was inferred based on data for the Bat Eagle Ray (Myliobatis californicus). TheÂ Bat Eagle RayÂ has an age-at-maturity of five years and a maximum age of 24 years and, thus, a generation length of 14.5 years (Martin and Caillet 1988). TheÂ Common Eagle RayÂ has a smaller maximum size (150 cm DW) than the Bat Eagle Ray (180 cm DW), and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred to be 12 years for the Common Eagle Ray.","The Common Eagle Ray is demersal and semi-pelagic in shallow coastal waters on the continental shelf and offshore toÂ aÂ depth ofÂ 537 m and often swims in groups (WhiteheadÂ et al.Â 1984,Â LastÂ et al.Â 2016).

The hydrographic conditions where it has been found suggest that it prefers temperatures that are > 6Â°C and salinities that are > 35 practical salinity units. If this is the case, the maximum depth of this species is c. 1,300 m (Stehmann 1976, Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, Stehmann et al. 2008).  Like other skates, this is likely an egg-laying species. Size at maturity for males is 20â25 cm total length (TL) and unknown for females. A 19.6 cm TL male found was immature while a 27 cm TL male was mature (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). The maximum reported size for this species is a 32 cm TL male (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, QuÃ©ro et al. 2003).","The Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ is a rarely encountered species that is morphologically very similar to the Sand Tiger (Carcharias taurus)Â but larger and bulkier, and has been observed or captured across a much broader depth range (10â880 m).Â The species mainlyÂ lives close to the seabed around islands and underwater seamounts characterised by narrow, steeply sloping shelves, or in the deep waters of continental outer shelves and upper slopes of larger land masses.Â FergussonÂ et al.Â (2008) report diver observations and photographs of the Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ in depths less than 50 m in widely separated locations including Pemba Island (Tanzania), Cocos-Keeling Island in the Indian Ocean, Malpelo Island (Columbia), and the Kermadec and White Islands (New Zealand); all these habitats comprised rocky substrates shelving steeply into deep water. Similarly, most Mediterranean Sea captures were by gillnets and vertical longlines set on steep, rocky ground, although usually at greater depths (100â300 m) than the dive sites (FergussonÂ et al.Â 2008). Demersal trawls generally require relatively smooth substrate for the gear to operate, and the many trawl captures off South Africa and southeastern Australia indicate that the Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ also frequents smooth terrain, at least in deepwater. Remote video recordings in the Gulf of Mexico showed the speciesÂ swimming in 450 m depth over areas ofÂ Lophelia coral reef (Sulak et al. 2007). The records from mid-water trawls in open waters of the Indian Ocean were proximal to deepsea ridges and seamounts, suggesting that the species may also inhabit the pelagicÂ zone, possibly while moving between shallower localities.Little is known of the biology of this shark but its reproduction may be similar to that of the Sand Tiger. The maximum recorded size for females is 450 cm TL and 344 cm TL for males but there were insufficient data for FergussonÂ et al.Â (2008)Â to precisely define the size at maturity: males were estimated to mature between 200 and 250 cm TL and females between 300 and 350 cm TL. Age and growth data are not available for the Smalltooth Sand Tiger, but generation length can be estimated from the Sand Tiger (C. taurus) from the Northwest Atlantic which has a female age of maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 35 years, resulting in a generation length of 20.5 years.Compagno (2001) cites an observation which suggests the species practices uterine cannibalism in the form of oophagy, resulting in the birth of single embryos from each uterus. The smallest recorded neonate, from Taiwan, wasÂ 101 cm TL and exhibited an umbilical scar (Hsu et al. 2013); this is within the birth size of 100â110 cm TLÂ suggestedÂ by Fergusson et al. (2008), a size proportionally consistent with the size at birth for the smallerÂ Sand TigerÂ (95â105 cm TL; Compagno 2001). ItÂ probably has a non-continuous breeding cycle similar to, or possibly more extended than the Sand Tiger. The gestation period for the Sand TigerÂ is 9â12 months with a probable rest year between pregnancies (Compagno 2001). An analysis by FergussonÂ et al.Â (2008)Â of 64 Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ captures worldwide found a weak inverse relationship between shark size and depth (R2Â = 0.129; p < 0.05), with small juveniles almost exclusively occurring in deepwater (>200 m). Mature-sizedÂ Smalltooth Sand TigersÂ were caught across their whole depth range (15â880 m) but almost all small juveniles (<150 cm TL) came from depths greater than 200 m suggesting that parturition occurs in relatively deep water.","The Angular Roughshark is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 35â805 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm total length (TL), but most individuals are less than 100 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Males mature at ~60 cm TL and females mature at ~65 cm TL (CapapÃ©Â et al.Â 1999).Â Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, litter size is 7â23 pups, and size-at-birth is 21â24 cm TLÂ (CapapÃ©Â et al.Â 1999).Â Age parameters are unknown and are inferred from another species in the family Squalidae, the Shortnose Spurdog (Squalus megalops) which has a female age-at-maturity of 19 years and a maximum age of 25 years, resulting in a generation length of 19.5 years (Rigby et al. 2016). This is similar to the generation length of 20 years that has been used for other Oxynotus spp. (Soldo and Guallart 2015).","The Sailfin Roughshark is demersal on the continental slope at depths of 265â1,104 m (Pajuelo et al. 2016, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 118 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous and size-at-birth is ~25 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Nothing else is known of its biology.Â Age parameters are unknown and are inferred from another species in the family Squalidae, the Shortnose Spurdog (Squalus megalops) which has a female age-at-maturity of 19 years and a maximum age of 25 years, resulting in a generation length of 19.5 years (Rigby et al. 2016). This is similar to the generation length of 20 years that has been used for other Oxynotus spp. (Soldo and Guallart 2015).","The Blue Shark is an oceanic pelagic shark, that occurs close inshore where the continental shelf is narrow (Last and Stevens 2009), and is found from the surface down to depths  of 1,000 m (Weigmann 2016). It also occurs in inshore waters where the continental shelf is narrow (Last and Stevens 2009). The Blue Shark is highly migratory with movement patterns associated with  reproduction and prey distribution (Nakano and Stevens 2008). The species reaches a maximum size of  about 380 cm total length (TL) (Hart 1973). Males mature at 183â218 cm TL, females mature at 183â221 cm TL (Pratt 1979, Nakano 1994, Carrera-Fernandez et al. 2010). Reproduction is placental viviparous with a gestation of 9â12 months, an annual to biennial reproductive cycle, and large litters sizes of 4â135 (usually 25â35), with a size at birth of 35â60 cm TL (Pratt 1979, Stevens 1984, Nakano 1994, Hazin et al. 1994, Clarke et al. 2015). There is minor regional variation in female age at maturity  at 5â6 years in the Atlantic and 5â8 years in the Pacific with a maximum  age of 15.5â16 years in both regions; generation length is therefore 10  years in the Atlantic and 10.5 years in the Pacific (Nakano 1994,  Skomal and  Natanson 2003, Blanco-Parra et al. 2008, Jolly et al. 2013). There are age studies with a greater maximum age of up to 28.6 years, however these are theoretical longevity estimates and the maximum ages have not been validated (Hsu et al. 2011, 2012, 2015; Rice and Semba 2014,Â Andrade et al. 2019).   The Blue Shark has the highest known population growth rates for pelagic sharks; that is, 0.287â0.314 in the North Atlantic, 0.299 in  the South Atlantic, and 0.264â0.331 in the Indian Ocean (Dulvy et al. 2008, Cortes et al. 2015, Murua et al. 2018).","Currently, life history information for the Smalltooth Sawfish is only available for the Western Atlantic and it assumed that life history parameters are similar for conspecifics throughout the Atlantic Ocean. This species is lecithotrophic viviparous and litter size is thought to be 15â20 pups (Simpfendorfer 2005) born every other year, but there are little supporting data for this. Demographic analysis using early reports of life history and estimates from other pristids indicated that Smalltooth Sawfish intrinsic rate of increase ranged from 0.08 to 0.13 yrâ1, and population doubling times from 5.4 to 8.5 yrs (Simpfendorfer 2000).There is still some question regarding age and size at maturity for Smalltooth Sawfish. Simpfendorfer (2005) reported maturity at 360 cm TL for females. However, females of 300â400 cm stretched total length (STL) necropsied from the US were immature, with the smallest mature female examined being 415 cm STL (J.K. Carlson unpublished data). Males were thought to be mature about 270 cm TL (Simpfendorfer 2005). However, a recently necropsied male Smalltooth Sawfish that was 308 cm TL was found to be immature (J.K. Carlson unpublished data). The smallest mature male from field-collected specimens was 371 cm STL (J.K. Carlson unpublished data). Back-transforming these lengths into ages using the von Bertalanffy growth model of Scharer et al. (2012) indicates that males mature around 7.5 years and females 10â12 years. As these data indicate much faster growth and earlier maturation than previously determined, any updated demographic model will likely indicate higher productivity and rebound potential. Moreno Iturria (2012) constructed a deterministic model based on standard life table techniques using growth estimates from Simpfendorfer et al. (2008) and calculated demographic parameters for Smalltooth Sawfish for US waters. Intrinsic rates of increase were estimated as 0.07 per year, generation time 17 years and population doubling time 9.7 years.Recent information on tag-recaptured juvenile Smalltooth Sawfish collected in Florida, USA, indicates substantially faster growth than previously assumed for this species. Simpfendorfer et al. (2008) found that growth was rapid during the first two years after birth.Using data from reported encounters from 1998 to 2008, Wiley and Simpfendorfer (2010) evaluated Smalltooth Sawfish habitat use patterns in the US. There was an inverse relationship between sawfish size and extent of northern distribution, with animals less than 200 cm having a wider latitudinal distribution and occurring farthest north, and animals greater than 200 cm reported mostly in southern Florida (Wiley and Simpfendorfer 2010). Most encounters occurred in estuarine and nearshore habitats, and their locations were not randomly distributed, having a positive association with inshore mangrove and seagrass habitats. While sawfish were reported in depths to 73 m, there was a significant relationship between size and depth, with smaller animals occurring in shallower waters (Wiley and Simpfendorfer 2010).Data from acoustic telemetry and tag-recapture information indicates Smalltooth Sawfish (less than 100 cm) had the smallest home ranges, low linearity of movement, and a preference for very shallow mud banks (Simpfendorfer et al. 2010). Juveniles greater than 100 cm demonstrated larger home ranges, preference for shallow mud/sand banks, and remained close to mangrove shorelines. Tide was found to be the main factor influencing movement on short time scales. Sawfish <150 cm STL spend the majority of their time in water <0.5 m deep, while larger juveniles spend most of their time in water 0.5â1.0 m deep. Juveniles >130 cm had high levels of site fidelity for specific nursery areas for periods up to almost 3 months, but the smaller juveniles had relatively short site fidelity to specific locations (Simpfendorfer et al. 2010).Based on data from catch-per-unit effort (CPUE), Poulakis et al. (2011) found that most juvenile Smalltooth Sawfish had an affinity for water less than 1.0 m deep, water temperature over 30ÂºC, dissolved oxygen over 6 mg/L, and salinity between 18 and 30. Greater catch rates for sawfish over age one were associated with shoreline habitats with overhanging vegetation such as mangroves (Poulakis et al. 2011).Simpfendorfer et al. (2011) conducted a long-term tracking study and found mean daily activity space was 1.42 km of river distance. The distance between 30-minute centres of activity was typically 0.1 km, suggesting limited movement over short time scales. Salinity electivity analysis demonstrated an affinity for salinities between 18 and at least 24, suggesting movements are likely made in part, to remain within this range (Simpfendorfer et al. 2011).The US National Marine Fisheries Service designated critical habitat for the US distinct population segment of Smalltooth Sawfish (Norton et al. 2012). The nursery habitats essential to the conservation of the species were identified as those adjacent to red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) and euryhaline habitats with water depths less than or equal to 0.9 m (Norton et al. 2012).For adult sawfish, unpublished data from pop-off archival satellite transmitting (PAT) tags indicate Smalltooth Sawfish spend the majority of their time in shallow waters (<10 m deep) and prefer temperatures between 22Â°C and 28Â°C (J.K. Carlson unpublished data). The maximum recorded depth for Smalltooth Sawfish is 88 m.","Available life history information on Largetooth Sawfish comes from in Lake Nicaragua in Central America (Thorson 1976; 1982) and from northern Australia.Largetooth Sawfish are generally restricted to shallow (<10 m) coastal, estuarine, and fresh waters, although they have been found at depths of up to 26 m in Lake Nicaragua. Largetooth Sawfish move across salinity gradients freely and in northern Australia, parturition probably occurs in brackish or saltwater and juveniles spend ~4â5 years in the freshwater reaches of rivers and floodplain waterholes before migrating to estuarine and marine waters (Thorburn et al. 2007, Peverell 2008, Whitty et al. 2008, Whitty et al. 2009, P. Kyne unpublished data). In Lake Nicaragua, individuals spent much, if not all, of their lives in freshwater with reproduction of the population occurring primarily in the lake (Thorson 1982).The life history of Largetooth Sawfish, like many elasmobranchs, is characterised by slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity, which generally contributes to a low intrinsic rate of increase. The maximum reported size of Largetooth Sawfish is 656 cm TL, although it has been estimated up to 700 cm TL (Compagno and Last 1999). Very large individuals are now rarely seen anywhere in the Indo-West Pacific.The reproductive method of sawfishes is most likely lecithotrophic viviparity. The only known reproductive study of Largetooth Sawfish was from Lake Nicaragua in the 1970s (Thorson 1976) with other observations from northern Australia. Thorson (1976) found that both ovaries appeared to be functional, though the left seemed to be larger and carry more ova. Litter sizes in Lake Nicaragua were 1â13 (mean 7.3) following a gestation period of about five months. While the reproductive cycle is possibly biennial in the Western Atlantic (Thorson 1976), it appears to be annual in northern Australia (Peverell 2008).Size at birth ranges 72â90 cm TL (Peverell 2008). Size at maturity is ~300 cm TL for females and ~280â300 cm TL for males (Thorburn et al. 2007, Peverell 2008, Whitty et al. 2008). Age at maturity in Queensland, northern Australia, has been estimated at 8â10 years (Peverell 2008). Peverell (2008) using a preliminary vertebral growth ring analysis estimated a maximum age of 35 years in northern Australia.Using life history information from populations in Central America, Simpfendorfer (2000) estimated an intrinsic rate of increase of 0.05 to 0.07 per year and population doubling times of 10.3â13.6 years. These rates were estimated under ideal conditions (i.e. no fisheries, no population fragmentation, no habitat modification and no inbreeding depression). Moreno Iturria (2012) estimated an intrinsic rate of population increase of 0.12 yr-1, a population doubling time of 5.8 yrs and a generation time of 14.6 yrs for Indo-West Pacific Largetooth Sawfish, and an intrinsic rate of population increase of 0.03 yr-1, a population doubling time of 23.3 yrs and a generation time of 17.2 yrs for Western Atlantic Largetooth Sawfish.","The False Catshark is a large deepwater benthic shark recorded from depths of 100 to 1,890 m on the continental and insular slopes, including around seamounts, troughs and deepwater reefs. This species is occasionally recorded on the continental shelves including in shallow water. This may be abnormal behaviour or where submarine canyons extend close to shore. The anatomy of this shark (large body cavity, soft fins, musculature and skin) suggests an inactive and sluggish lifestyle (Ebert et al. 2013).  Maximum size 296 cm total length (TL) (female), 295 cm TL (male) (Yano 1992); males mature at about 260 cm TL, females at about 265 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Taniuchi et al. (1984) observed near-term embryos of 112 and 113 cm TL, and Yano (1992) at 116 to 120 cm TL. A 156 cm TL immature female had an umbilical scar (Yano 1992). Size at birth 120 to 150 cm TL (K. Yano, unpubl. data).   Forster et al. (1970) suggested that the False Catshark was oophagous based on the large number of ova (estimated at 20,000) of 9 mm mean diameter observed in the ovary of a 280 cm TL female. Taniuchi et al. (1984) reported mid-term and near-term embryos with stomachs full of yolk. Yano (1992) confirmed the existence of oophagy in this species showing that embryos ingest and utilize yolk material from ovulated ova. Yolk material was observed in the uteri of gravid females and the stomachs of two embryos contained yolk material and egg capsules. Yano (1992) reported that the reproductive mode in this species is a modified form of oophagy in which embryos appear to transfer yolk from ingested egg fragments to their external yolk sac, replenishing external yolk sac reserves and using them in the last stages of gestation. Reported litter size of this species is two (Taniuchi et al. 1984, Yano 1992, Stewart 2000). Gestation period is unknown, but is presumed to be > 1 year and possibly more than 2 or 3 years (K. Yano, unpubl. data).","The Pelagic Stingray is perhaps the only species of stingray that occurs in the pelagic zone (Last and Stevens 2009). It is usually found from the surface to 100 m depth over deep water, but has been reported to 381 m (Mollet 2002, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 90 cm disc width (DW); females mature at 39â50 cm DW; and males mature at 35â41 cm DW (Junior and Rotundo 2012, Veras et al. 2014, LastÂ et al.Â 2016). Reproduction is viviparous with litter sizes of 2â13 and size at birth of 14â24 cm DW (Wilson and  Beckett 1970, Mollet 2002, Mollet et al. 2002, Forselledo et al. 2008, Neer 2008, Veras et al. 2014, Last et al. 2016). Females mature at 3 years; males mature at 2 years; and maximum age is about 10  years; generation length is therefore 6.5 years (Wilson and  Beckett 1970, Mollet et al. 2002, Neer 2008).","Starry Skates are found predominantly on the Italian and Corsica continental shelves between shallow waters and 150 m depth (Baino and Serena 2000). In the eastern Ionian Sea, the species is found down to depths of 343 m (Mytilineou et al. 2005), although this is probably due to misidentifications. The species prefers muddy and sandy bottoms (Vannucci 2005).   Maximum size is estimated at 72 cm total length (TL) for males and of 76 cm TL for females (Bono et al. 2005, Serena and Abella 1999). Barone et al. (2006) and Serena et al. (2005) estimate length at maturity at 51.7 cm TL for males and 56.1 cm TL for females, and Serena and Abella (1999) and Bauchot (1987) reported length at maturity at 45 to 54 cm TL for males and 60 cm TL for females. Age at maturity is reported at three to four years for both males and females (Serena and Abella 1999, Bono et al. 2005). The species is egg laying, with 34 to 112 egg cases laid depending on individual size, and egg cases can reach 45 mm in length and 30 mm width (Bauchot 1987). Juveniles are about 8 cm TL when they emerge from the egg cases in January. The sex ratio is about 1:1 (Minervini et al. 1985, Abella et al. 1997). Juveniles move quickly into shallow waters from 5-7 m depth soon after birth and then move into deeper waters progressively as they grow (Abella and Serena 2002, Catalano et al. 2003).  Recent preliminary tagging experiments (Catalano et al. 2003) suggest a faster growth rate than described in previous literature (Serena and Abella 1999). As this species reaches maturity relatively early (~3 years) and has a short lifespan (~10 years) it is considered to be relatively productive, even though it is only moderately fecund.   In the Central Tyrrhenian Sea, length at 50% maturity values estimated by Romanelli et al. (2007) were 56.5cm TL and 50.5cm TL for females and males, respectively. In the south Ligurian Sea, males mature by 45 cm TL and females may mature by 53 cm TL (Barone et al. 2007). Total length at 50% maturity was estimated to be 51.7 cm and 56.1 cm TL for males and females respectively. In the Catalan Sea, the size at first maturity for females was assessed to be around 48.1 cm TL, while males showed a maturing phase from 45 to 51 cm TL (Coll et al. 2013). These estimates are lower than the ones reported in the Gulf of Tunisia (CapapÃ© 1977). The annual rate of population increase is 0.247 year-1, and estimated generation time is 4.36 years; the time taken to double the population is 2.81 years (Abella et al. 2011). The estimated generation length is around 6 years.","Raja brachyura is most common on sandy sediments in waters down to about 150 m deep (Ellis et al. 2005a) in the Northeast Atlantic, though may occur deeper in the southern parts of its range. In the Mediterranean Sea it is mainly found at depths of 10-150 m to about 300 m (Baino et al. 2001). It reaches a maximum size of ~120 cm (TL) (Stehmann and Burkel 1984) and commonly reaches 40-80 cm TL. Like other skates, reproduction is oviparous. They reproduce from February to August and have a gestation period of almost seven months, with females producing about 30 egg cases/year (measuring about 12 x 8 cm, excluding horns) (Stehmann and Burkel 1984). Juveniles feed on small crustaceans (amphipods, natantids), with larger individuals more piscivorous and predating on dragonet and sand eels (Ellis et al. 1996). Little is known about its reproductive biology.","The Thornback Skate is a demersal coastal species which inhabits a variety of substrates, including mud, sand, shingle, gravel and rocky areas, in water down to 300 m, although it is most abundant in 10-60 m of water off coastal areas (Wheeler 1969, Stehmann and Buerkel 1984). Rousset (1990a) studied the elasmobranch assemblage off the coast of Brittany and found that R. clavata was the most abundant rajid due to the fact that it was able to inhabit this range of benthic habitats. Thornback Skate is the second most important species, after the Smallspotted Catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula), in the demersal elasmobranch assemblage in the northern Bristol Channel and constitutes between 7.4-8.8% of the elasmobranch biomass (Ellis unpubl.). The age and growth of this species have been studied by examining the vertebrae of fish caught in the Bristol Channel (Ryland and Ajayi 1984), although Brander and Palmer (1985), using length-frequency analysis, have indicated inconsistencies for the smaller sized fish used in this work. Ryland and Ajayi (1984) gave maximum age and length of 12 years and 1,047 mm (k = 0.090). Vertebral growth rings have been shown to be annual (Holden and Vince 1973). Growth has also been estimated from tagging studies (Holden 1972). Validated age studies of specimens from the southern North Sea have shown thornback skates to have a maximum length of 118 cm for females and 98cm for males (Walker 1998). The size at maturity for females and males have been estimated at 45-50 cm disc width (DW) and 38-44 cm DW (Fitzmaurice 1974); 85 cm total length (TL) (54 cm DW) and 75 cm TL (48 cm DW) (CapapÃ© 1976); 45 cm DW and 42 cm DW (Nottage and Perkins 1983) and 59 cm TL and 60 cm TL (Ryland and Ajayi 1984). Walker (1998) estimated length at 50% maturity to be 77 cm TL for males and 68 cm TL for females. The corresponding ages at 50% maturity were eight and seven years. It has been reported that R. clavata first spawn in their fifth year (Ryland and Ajayi 1984). Eggs are laid during a protracted breeding season from February to September (Holden 1975), with a peak in May and June. However, this is for the population as a whole and the egg-laying period for individual fish may be shorter. Ellis and Shackley (1995) maintained one female in captivity and reported that egg laying lasted six weeks, with a mean egg-laying rate of 1.07 eggs per day, a pair of eggs being laid on alternate days. These data concur with the observations of Holden (1971). Development lasts 16-20.5 weeks (Ellis and Shackley 1995), although this period may vary with temperature. The young hatch at a length of 10-13 cm. The nursery areas used are coastal, estuarine and tidal flat areas (e.g., the Wash and Thames estuary in the UK). The fecundity of R. clavata in British waters has been estimated at 150 eggs per year (Holden 1971), 140 eggs per year (Holden 1975) and 100 eggs per year (minimum of 62-74) (Ryland and Ajayi 1984). CapapÃ© (1976, 1977a) estimated a fecundity of 70-167 eggs per year in Tunisian waters, although it may be as low as 48 (Ellis and Shackley 1995). The feeding habits have been well documented from many areas over its geographical range, including British waters (Holden and Tucker 1974, Ajayi 1982, Ellis et al. 1996), Ireland (Fitzmaurice 1974), France (Du Buit 1968, 1978-79, Quiniou and Andriamirado 1979), Portugal (Marques and Re 1978, Cunha et al. 1986), the Mediterranean (CapapÃ© 1975, 1977; Abdel-Aziz 1986), the Southeast Atlantic waters off Namibia (Macpherson 1986) and southern Africa (Ebert et al. 1991). Young and juvenile R. clavata predominantly eat small crustaceans, such as shrimps, mysids, amphipods and small crabs. Larger specimens prey on larger crustaceans, including prawns and crabs and will also consume fish. The migratory habits have been studied by Steven (1936) who found that very little movement occurred, especially in young fish, with 71% of tagged fish moving less than five miles. Fish tagged in the southern North Sea also showed a sedentary pattern, with 80% being recaptured within 40 nautical miles of their release position (Walker et al. 1997). The recapture percentage was nearly 30%. Fitzmaurice (1974) studied the populations within two bays in Ireland and reported a sex ratio of 1:1 and, of 71 tagged, eight (11.3%) recaptures. Rousset (1990b) observed that mature females were more common in exposed areas and juveniles and mature males were more common in more sheltered areas.","Juveniles tend to occur in relatively shallow water, with larger individuals more abundant further from shore, though it is uncommon in waters more than 100m deep (Ellis et al. 2005a). The Smalleyed Ray attains a maximum length of 91 cm total length (LT ) and begins to mature at 57.5-58 cm LT (Ryland and Ajayi 1984). The fecundity has been estimated at 54-61 eggs per year, with egg-laying activity peaking between June and September (Ryland and Ajayi 1984). Size at birth is approximately 10 cm TL (Ryland and Ajayi 1984).The feeding habits have been described for those populations inhabiting Carmarthen Bay (Ajayi 1977, 1982; Ellis unpublished) and the Cove of Bertheaume in Brittany (Rousset 1987) and it is known that they feed on a variety of crustaceans and teleosts (Fowler et al. 2005). Juveniles predate primarily on small shrimps and amphipods, with fishes (e.g., sand eels and dragonets) becoming more important in the diets of larger individuals.","The Brown Skate occurs on sandy-muddy substrates andÂ PosidoniaÂ seagrass beds on the continental shelf and upper slope primarily at depths of 50â150 m, but has been recorded down to 555 m (ReliniÂ et al.Â 1999, Serena 2005, Last et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of ~60 cm total length (TL) and females reach at least 9â10 years of age (Abdel-Aziz 1992, KadriÂ et al.Â 2012, LastÂ et al.Â 2016). Females mature between 33 and 48 cm TL with a length at 50% maturity of 41.8 cm TL, at an age of 50% maturity of 4.4 years (Kadri et al. 2012).Â Reproduction is oviparous and the size at hatching is approximately 5 cm TL (ReliniÂ et al.Â 1999).Â Generation length is 7.2 years (calculated as the midpoint between females age at 50% maturity of 4.4 and maximum age of 10 years).","Raja montagui is most common on sandy sediments in coastal and shelf seas (Ellis et al. 2005a), though may occur deeper in the southern parts of its range. Raja montagui is found at intermediate depths on the shallow shelf and was captured in the MEDITS surveys at depths between 28 to 530 m, but the bulk of the population appears to exist between 100 to 500 m (Baino et al. 2001). Adults have an average total length of 60 cm (Bauchot 1987), and the maximum recorded length is 80 cm (Ellis et al. 2005b). Maximum fecundity of approximately 60 to 70 (Holden et al. 1971, Walker 1999). Juveniles feed on small crustaceans (amphipods, natantids), with larger individuals predating on larger crustaceans, and fishes. Basic information on their reproductive biology is available, though better data on fecundity are required.","The species is benthic, and it inhabits mainly soft bottoms from 100-400 m (Serena 2005), but with a wide depth range from 20-633 m. Both males and females are estimated to mature at 40-53 cm total length (TL) with a maximum recorded size of 60 cm TL (Tortonese 1956, Bini 1967, Bauchot 1987, Stehmann and Burkel 1984, Notarbartolo di Sciara and Bianchi 1998, Serena 2005). It is common at sizes of 30-40 cm TL (Bauchot 1987). Like other skates, this species is egg laying. Reproduction takes place in winter and 20-62 egg cases (depending on size) are laid per year (Bauchot 1987, Stehmann and Burkel 1984, Serena 2005). The egg-cases measure 46 by 35 mm excluding horns (Stehmann and Burkel 1984, Serena 2005).","This skate is found in coastal waters to depths of ~350 m (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, Serena 2005). Around the Balearic Islands it is relatively common at <40 m depth. Like all skates, this is an egg-laying species. Egg cases are 5.1â5.7 cm long and are laid throughout the year (Kadri et al. 2013), though mainly in spring and summer. Embryos develop in about four months (Stehman and BÃ¼rkel 1984, Serena 2005). Females mature at 34 cm disc width (DW) and males at 30 cm DW in the Mediterranean Sea (Fischer et al. 1987, Serena et al. 2010). Maximum body size is ~70 cm total length (TL) (Fischer et al. 1987, Serena et al. 2010). Most captured specimens off the Balearic Islands measure about 30â50 cm TL (Morey et al. 2009). From the Gulf of GabÃ¨s, length at maturity is reportedly 47.05 cm TL for males and 56.48 cm TL for females (Kadri et al. 2013). The age at 50% maturity was estimated to be 4.47 and 5.89 years for males and females, respectively. Maximum age and length were 12 years and 80 cm TL for females, and nine years and 65 cm TL for males. The generation length of this species is therefore estimated to beÂ about nine years.","This skate occurs in shelf waters to about 200 m depth, on sandy and muddy substrates and appears to be more common in shallow waters (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, Coelho and Erzini 2006). Smaller specimens have been reported in coastal lagoons (specifically in the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon on the South coast of Portugal), which suggests that this species may use these sheltered habitats as nursery areas (Coelho et al. 2002). Like other skates, reproduction is oviparous. Estimated asymptotic maximum size is110 cm total length (TL) (Coelho and Erzini 2002). Significant regional differences have been observed in size at first maturity of this species: In Portugal, females mature (50% maturity) at 76.2 cm TL in the Algarve (southern) region and at 83.8 cm TL in the Peniche (western) region, while males mature (50% maturity) at 73.6 cm TL in the Algarve and at 78.1 cm TL in Peniche. Age at first maturity for the Algarve population has been estimated to occur at 8.98 years in females and 7.66 years in males (Coelho and Erzini 2006). An annual reproductive cycle has been observed, but differences occur between the different populations: In southern Portugal this species breeds mainly during the winter (Coelho and Erzini 2006), while in the Portuguese west coast it breeds during the winter and the spring (Moura et al. 2007). These differences seem to be related to water temperature, with reproduction restricted to periods of colder water. The maximum observed age for this species is 13 years old (Coelho and Erzini 2002) but longevity has been estimated at 21-23 years (Coelho et al. 2002). The population on the South Portuguese coast has a very slow growth rate (k=0.11) (Coelho and Erzini 2002). Natural mortality for this population has been estimated to be 0.20-0.219 year-1 (Coelho et al. 2002).Generation period for this species varies from 14.9-15.9 years in females and from 14.3-15.3 in males. Generation period was estimated using the following formula: average reproductive age = age at maturity + 0.5* (longevity - age at maturity).R. undulata shows a dietary ontogenetic shift within three major length groups: 20-55 cm TL; 55-75 cm TL and 75-100 cm TL. This shift goes from small semi-pelagic to larger and benthic prey and from a generalised to a specialised diet. Shrimps and mysids are especially important in the diet of smaller specimens, while in larger specimens brachyuran crabs have an increased importance (Moura et al. 2008).","Bigelowâs Skate is demersal on continental and insular slopes from 625 to 2,200 m, and possibly deeper on the abyssalÂ plain to 4,155 m (Ebert and Stehman 2013, Last et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 55 cm total length (TL), males mature at 40â45 cm TL (Ebert and Stehman 2013). Reproduction is oviparous and young hatch at 12 cm TL (Ebert and Stehmann 2013, Last et al. 2016).  ","Round Skate is demersal on continental and insular shelves and slopes from 150 to 2,055 m (Ebert and Stehmann 2013, Last et al. 2016), mainly distributed between 500â1,450 m, with 1,450 m being the maximum depth surveyedÂ (D.W. Kulka unpub. data 2019). It reaches a maximum size of 56 cm total length (TL), males and females mature at 45â50 cm TL (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). Reproduction is oviparous and young hatch at 7 cm TL (Ebert and Stehmann 2013, Last et al. 2016). Age data are not available for this species, but data from the similar-sized Sandpaper Skate (Bathyraja kincaidii) was used to estimate a generation length of 11.5 years (PerezÂ et al.Â 2011).","This bathydemersal species is found at depths of 775â1,500 m, with the majority of individuals captured at depths below 1,000 m (ICES 2006). The average depth of all known records is 1,179 m.   This species is presumably egg laying like other skates, but nothing else is known of its reproductive biology. It reaches a maximum body size of at least 83 cm total length (TL; Dolganov 1985). IglÃ©sias (2012) reported a maximum size of 79â84 cm TL for mature males, while Rodriguez-Caballo (2012) reported maximum sizes of 56.8 and 72.9 cm TL for males and females, respectively. ","The Common Guitarfish is demersal across sandy, muddy, and shelly habitats, and occurs inshore on the continental shelf to a depth of 180 m (Ebert and Stehmann 2013).Â It reaches a maximum size of 162 cm total length (TL), males mature at 56â79 cm TL and females mature at 64â85 cm TL (CapapÃ©Â et al. 1996, Last et al. 2016).Â Reproduction isÂ lecithotrophic viviparous with litters of 1â13 pups born after a gestation period of 10â12 months at a size-at-birth of 25â30 cm TL (Enajjar et al. 2008, Last et al. 2016). The age at maturity is two to three years and maximum age is at least 24 years; generation length is therefore 14 yearsÂ (IsmenÂ et al.Â 2007, BaÅustaÂ et al.Â 2008).","The Atlantic Longnose Chimaera has been recorded from the upper and mid continental slopes at depths of 400â1,800 m, and generally at depths >1,000 m (Didier 2016). It reaches a length of at least 147 cm total length (TL)/90 cm body length (BDL) (Ebert and Stehmann 2013, Pascual et al. 2017). Maturity is estimated at ~107 cm TL and ~127 cm TL for males and females, respectively (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). Size-at-birth ~15 cm TL (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). Like other chimaeras, it is oviparous.","The Lusitanian Cownose Ray is a benthopelagic ray that occurs inshore over sandy substrates in shallow bays, lagoons and estuaries, from nearshore to a depth of 100 m (Last et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 200 cm disc width (DW),Â males mature at 64â77 cm DW and females mature atÂ 66â80 cm DWÂ (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016, Last et al. 2016, Tirasin and Basusta 2018). Reproduction isÂ lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of one pup, a gestation period of one year and size-at-birth of 23Â cm DWÂ (ValadouÂ et al.Â 2006, LastÂ et al.Â 2016). There is no information on this species' age-at-maturity and maximum age, hence, generation length was inferred based on data for the Cownose Ray (Rhinoptera bonasus) that has an age-at-maturity of 7.5 years and a maximum age of 21 years, resulting in a generation length of 14.3 years (FisherÂ et al.Â 2013). The Lusitanian Cownose RayÂ has a larger maximum size than theÂ Cownose Ray (200 cm vs 104 cm DW) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred to be 27.5 years for the Lusitanian Cownose Ray. Cownose rays are among the least productive elasmobranchs with an  estimated intrinsic rate of population growth rates (r) ranging from 0.018 yrâ1 to 0.032 yrâ1 (median r = 0.008) (GrubbsÂ et al.Â 2016).","This is a benthic species of sandy and detrital bottoms from coastal waters to the upper slope region between about 40 to 400 m and exceptionally down to 500 m (Capape 1976, Stehmann and Burkel 1984, Serena 2005). Du Buit 1974 reports this species to be more prevalent in rocky habitats.  Little is known of this species' life history and ecology.  Estimates of size at maturity are 130 cm (males) and 120 cm (females) (Capape 1976).  Maximum recorded size is 200 cm, even if is common between 60 and 150 cm of total length (Bauchot 1987). Gestation period is 15 months and females produce between 55 to 156 ova per year, egg cases are 160 to 200 cm in length and 130 to 150 cm in width (Stehmann and Burkel 1984, Serena 2005). Age at maturity, longevity, size at birth, average reproductive age, reproductive periodicity, annual rate of population growth and natural mortality are all unknown for this skate.   The white skate feeds on all kinds of bottom dwelling animals (Stehmann and Burkel 1984), especially fish, crustaceans and cephalopods (Bauchot 1987).","The Smallspotted Catshark is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope from nearshore to a depth of 800 m (Weigmann 2016). It is reported to reach a maximum size of 100 cm total length (TL) in the Atlantic (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016), but it generally attains a maximum of 80 cm TL, and larger specimens may relate to misidentified with the Nursehound (S. stellaris)Â (EllisÂ 2015). It attains a smaller maximum size (60 cm TL)Â in the Mediterranean Sea. In the Atlantic, males mature at 53.5 cm TL and females mature at 57 cm TL; in the Mediterranean Sea, males mature at 39 cm TL and females mature at 44 cm TL (IvoryÂ et al.Â 2005, EbertÂ et al. 2013, Soares and de Carvalho 2019).Â Reproduction is oviparous, with egg cases laid year-round and size-at-birth is 9â10 cm TL (EbertÂ et al. 2013, Soares and de Carvalho 2019). In the Atlantic, estimated female age-at-maturity is 9 years and maximum age is 17 years, resulting in a generation length of 13 years (RodrÃ­guez-CabelloÂ et al.Â 2005b).","","The Nursehound is demersal on the insular and continental shelf and upper slope from nearshore to a depth of 380 m, and mostly occurs at depths of 20â63 m in rocky and seagrass habitats (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016).Â It is reported to reach a maximum size of 162 cm total length (TL), but mostly attains a length of ~125 cm TL (Ebert and Stehmann 2013, Weigmann 2016).Â Males mature at 77 cm TL and females mature at 79 cm TL in the Mediterranean Sea (Bauchot 1987). Reproduction is oviparous and size-at-birth is ~11 cm TL (Soares and de Carvalho 2019). Nothing else is known of its biology. Maximum age and age-at-maturity are unknown; maximum age is inferred from a congener, the Smallspotted Catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula), with female age-at-maturity of 9 years and a maximum age of 17 years (RodrÃ­guez-CabelloÂ et al.Â 2005). This results in a generation length of 13 years.Â The NursehoundÂ is larger thanÂ theÂ Small SpottedÂ CatsharkÂ (125 cm vs 100 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 16 years for Nursehound.","The Knifetooth Dogfish has been recorded from the continental slope at depths of 200â1,600 m (Ebert et al. 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 110 cm total length (TL) (Ebert et al. 2013). Nothing else is known of its biology.Â Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a related species, the Longnose Velvet Dogfish (Centroselachus crepidater) that has a female age-at-maturity of 20 years and a maximum age of 54 years, resulting in a generation length of 37 years (Irvine et al. 2006).","The Greenland Shark is demersal and mesopelagic on continental and insular shelves and upper slopes from the surface down to at least 2,647 m, but mainly at 300â500 m in Baffin Bay (Ebert et al.Â 2013, Campana et al. 2015, N.E. Hussey pers. comm. 26/08/2020). It tends to move inshore coastal areas in summer and offshore in winter (N.E. Hussey pers. comm. 26/08/2020). It reaches a maximum size of 640 cm total length (TL), possibly to 730 cm TL; males mature at 260 cm TL and females mature at 400 cm TL (MacNeilÂ et al.Â 2012).Â Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with at least 2 and a maximum of 10 pups per litter, the later based on a single individual (Koefoed 1957, Castro 2011) and sizeâatâbirth of 40â100 cm TL (YanoÂ et al. 2007, MacNeil et al. 2012, EbertÂ et al.Â 2013). Reproductive periodicity is assumed to be biennial based on other sleeper sharks (Somniosidae:Â Longnose Velvet DogfishÂ Centroselachus crepidaterÂ and Plunketâs Shark Scymnodon plunketi)Â (Simpfendorfer and Kyne 2009).Â Female age-at-maturity isÂ estimated asÂ 156 years and maximum age isÂ estimated asÂ 392 years (NielsenÂ et al.Â 2016); hence generation length could be as much as 274 years. However, the radiocarbon dating of eye lens structures relies on understanding 14C dynamics prior to nuclear weapons testing and the rate of mixing of surface waters into the deep ocean and these uncertainties can result in a wide range of birth dates (Natanson et al. 2018, M.A. MacNeil pers. comm. 27/07/2020). These sharks live in deep-water which is depleted in radiocarbon and hence it is difficult to determine what pre-and post-nuclear weapon-testing radiocarbon levels should be to serve as a baseline for aging (S.E. Campana pers. comm. 24/08/2020).Â It is likely that the generation length is more similar to other deep-water sharks at 50â75 years (S.E. Campana pers. comm. 24/08/2020). Here, we assume an intermediate generation length of 150 years.","The Little Sleeper Shark occurs on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 180â2,734 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 131.4 cm total length (TL). Males mature at ~70 cm TL and females mature at 80 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 6â9 pups and size-at-birth is 21â28 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Nothing else is known of its biology.","The Scalloped Hammerhead is a coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark,  found over continental and insular shelves and nearby deep water, ranging from the intertidal and surface usually to 275 m depth, though has been recorded to 1,043 m (Moore and Gates 2015). Adults spend most of the time offshore in midwater and females migrate  to the coastal areas to pup (Clarke 1971, Bass et al. 1975, Klimley and Nelson 1984, Branstetter 1987, Klimley 1987, Chen et al. 1988, Stevens and Lyle 1989). It reaches a maximum size of 370â420 cm total length (TL) (Ebert et al. 2013). Males mature at 140â198 cm TL and females at 200â250 cm TL (Compagno 1984, Branstetter 1987, Chen et al. 1990, Carrera and Martinez 2007, White et al. 2008, Harry et al. 2011).  Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 12â41, an annual or biennial reproductive cycle, and a size at birth of 31â57 cm TL (Branstetter 1987, Chen et al. 1988, 1990; Stevens and Lyle 1989, Oliveira 1991, Amorim et al. 1994, Oliveira et al. 1997, White et al. 2008, Harry et al. 2011, Clarke et al. 2015, Gallagher and Klimley 2018). Annual band pair deposition for the Scalloped Hammerhead is assumed based on bomb radiocarbon validation of the Great Hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) (Passerotti et al. 2010); female age-at-maturity of the Scalloped Hammerhead is 13.2 years and maximum age is 35 years; generation length is  therefore 24.1 years (Drew et al. 2015). Population growth rate estimates are 0.10â1.22 per year (Harry 2011, CortÃ©s et al. 2012).","The Great Hammerhead is a generally solitary, coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark, that occurs close inshore and well offshore at depths ranging  from near-surface to 300 m deep (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). The maximum size is reported as 550 to 610 cm total length (TL) reported by Compagno (1984), though 400 cm TL is a more commonly observed maximum size (Stevens and Lyle 1989, Last and Stevens 2009, Piercy et al. 2010, Harry et al. 2011). Males mature at 225â269 cm TL and females mature at 210â300 cm TL (Stevens and Lyle 1989, Harry et al. 2011, Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with litter size of 6â42 pups, a gestation time of 11 months, a likely biennial reproductive cycle, and a size-at-birth of 50â70 cm TL (Stevens and Lyle 1989, Harry et al. 2011, Ebert et al. 2013, Clarke et al. 2015). There is regional variation in age estimates; female age-at-maturity is 5.5 and 8.3 years and maximum age is 44 and 39 years; generation length is therefore 24.8 and 23.7 years in Northwest Atlantic and Western Central Pacific, respectively (Passerotti et al. 2010, Piercy et al. 2010, Harry et al. 2011). Population growth rate estimate is 0.07 per year (CortÃ©s et al. 2012).","The Smooth Hammerhead is a coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark that occurs on the continental shelf to at least 200 m depth, and possibly 500 m (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013, Weigmann 2016). It is the most oceanic of the hammerhead species, commonly leaving coastal habitats at 2â3 years of age (Clarke et al. 2015). Despite its widespread occurrence, biological data on this species is limited. It attains a maximum size of 370â400 cm total length (TL) (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013, Weigmann 2016). Males mature at  250â260 cm TL and females at about 246â265 cm TL (Stevens 1984, Castro and Mejuto 1995). Reproduction is viviparous with litter sizes of 20â50, a gestation period of 10â11 months, unknown reproductive periodicity, and a size-at-birth of 49â63 cm TL (Stevens 1975, Stevens 1984, Smale 1991, Castro and Mejuto 1995, DoÃ±o 2008, Francis 2010, Ebert et al. 2013, Clarke et al. 2015, Rosa et al. 2017, Gallagher and Klimley 2018). Female age-at-maturity is estimated as 15 years based on size-at-maturity and the growth curves from Rosa et al. (2017).  The maximum ages observed are 24 years for females and 25 years for  males (Rosa et al. 2017). However, these are unlikely to be the true maximum ages as   individuals from the study were a maximum size of 286 cm TL,  considerably less than the known maximum size (Rosa et al. 2017). Generation length is estimated at 24.1 years based on  that of Scalloped Hammerhead which reaches a similar size and has a maximum age of 35 years (Drew et al.  2015). Population growth rate estimate is among the fastest of the  known pelagic sharks and the fastest of the hammerhead species at 0.225  per year (CortÃ©s et al. 2012).    ","The Spined Pygmy Shark has been recordedÂ in epi- to mesopelagic waters over continental and insular shelves and slopesÂ at depths of 10â1,800 m, but mostly 60â750 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann, 2016).Â It reaches a maximum length of 27.5 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~15 cm TL and females mature at 17â20 cm TL (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013, Weigmann 2016).Â Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, litter size is 3â5 pups, and size-at-birth is 8â10 cm TL (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013). Nothing else is known of its biology.","The Spiny Dogfish is found inshore in enclosed and open bays and estuaries, as well as offshore along the continental and insular slopes from the surface to 1,978 m, with most records occurring at depths <600 m (Serena et al. 2009, Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum length of 200 cm total length (TL), although maximum size is highly variable across regions and most individuals are <100 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Maturity is also regionally variable; males mature between 52â100 cm TL and females mature 66â120 cm TL (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, litter size is 1â32 pups, gestation is 12â24 months, and size-at-birth is between 18â33 cm TL (Ford, 1921, EbertÂ et al.Â 2013).Â Using estimates from the Northwest Atlantic, female age-at-maturity is 9.1 years and maximum age is 24 years (BubleyÂ et al.Â 2013), therefore generation length is 17Â years.","The Longnose Spurdog is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 15â1,500, and usually shallower than 780 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 92 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016). There is likely regional variability in life history traits, with males mature at 46â52 cm TL and females mature at 56â63 cm TL (Kousteni and Megalofonou 2011, Marouani et al. 2012). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with a litter size of 3â4 pups and size-at-birth is ~23 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Female age-at-maturity is 7.4 years and maximum reported age is 19 years, resulting in a generation length of 13.2 years (Marouani et al. 2012).","The Sawback Angelshark is a coastal and shelf species that inhabits the uppermost slopes of the warm-temperate and tropical Eastern Atlantic. It lives on or near the seabed at depths of 30 to 500 m over soft substrates. The observed length of this shark at maturity is 120-122 cm total length (TL) for males and 137-143 cm TL for females. The maximum sizes reported by CapapÃ© et al. (2005) were 152 cm and 175 cm TL for males and females, respectively, although maximum sizes are estimated at around 188 cm TL (Compagno et al. 2005). The Sawback Angelshark is a lecithotrophic viviparous species, with two functional ovaries and uteri. Its gestation time was estimated at 1 year by CapapÃ© et al. (2005), with parturition probably occurring between May and July and with a reproductive periodicity of 2 years. The size at birth was estimated at 30-35 cm TL with litter sizes of 8-12 pups.The species' generation length is estimated at ~15 years, based on data for its relative the Pacific Angelshark (Squatina californica) (Cailliett et al. 1992).Â  ","The Smoothback Angelshark is a warm-temperate and tropical demersal species that inhabits sandy-muddy habitat on continental shelves and upper slopes from 10 to 500 m (mostly between 50 and 100 m and deeper in the tropics than in temperate seas).CapapÃ© et al. (1990) reported the occurrence of Smoothback Angelsharks at a depth range 50-200 m (and probably down to 300 m) in Tunisian waters, except for gravid females and young-of-the-year, suggesting that shallow waters in the Gulf of Tunis may act as a parturition and nursery area. Surveys off the West African coast indicate that the species may form aggregations in December (Litvinov 1993). Age at maturity, longevity, and reproductive age are all unknown. Females are reported to mature at 100 cm total length (TL) from Tunisian waters (CapapÃ© et al. 1990) and 89 cm TL from Senegal (CapapÃ© et al. 2002), males at 71 cm TL from Tunisia (CapapÃ© et al. 1990) and 82 cm TL from Senegal (CapapÃ© et al. 2002). They reach a maximum size of 160 cm TL in females (Compagno et al. 2005) and 145 cm TL in males (Ebert et al. 2013).This species is lecithotrophic viviparous, with both ovaries functional. A study from Senegal indicated that they give birth from February-April (after a maximum one year gestation period) to 3 to 8 young (CapapÃ© et al. 2002), ranging from 22.5-27 cm TL (Compagno 1984, CapapÃ© et al. 2002). The reproductive periodicity is biannual. The rate of population increase and natural mortality are all unknown.The species' generation length is estimated at ~15 years, based on data for its relative the Pacific Angelshark (Squatina californica) (Cailliett et al. 1992).Â  ","The Angelshark is a temperate bottom-dwelling shark of the continental shelves of Europe and the Mediterranean basin, occurring on or near the bottom from close inshore in the shallow sublittoral (<1 m depth) to at least 150 m depth. It may occasionally penetrate estuaries and brackish water.This shark prefers sandy bottoms, where it lies buried with little more than its eyes protruding in waiting for prey. The Angelshark is nocturnal and can be found swimming strongly off the bottom at night, but it rests on the bottom in daytime. It is likely to make seasonal inshore migrations that coincide with changes in water temperature or during the mating season (Meyers et al. 2017). In the northern parts of its range, the Angelshark was often reported seasonally, suggesting possible northward and/or inshore movements during the summer (Compagno et al. 2005). Tagging experiments performed in Tunisian waters showed that AngelsharksÂ are not prone to large movements in the area (Quignard and CapapÃ©  1971, CapapÃ© et al. 1990), with a range of 10-44 km away from  the tagging site after a range of 12-231 days. Markârecapture data for  Angelsharks tagged in Ireland have shown that a high proportion  of fish are recaptured from the original release location, although  occasionally individuals can undertake longer-distance movements of up  to 1,160 km (Quigley 2006).  Nearly 96% (179) of the recaptures were taken in Irish coastal waters  and only 4% (8) were recaptured from abroad (Quigley 2006). It has been  hypothesised that the species may undertake a summertime northward  migration into UK and Irish waters, supplementing a shoreward movement  from deeper offshore waters, but there is, as yet, little evidence to  confirm this.Females reach maturity at 128 to 169 cm total length (TL), and males at 80 to 132 cm TL off Tunisia (CapapÃ© et al. 1990) and at 102.8 and 99.9 cm TL, respectively, off of the Canary Islands (Osaer et al. 2015). They reach     maximum sizes of 244 cm TL (females) and 183 cm TL (males) (Compagno 1984, 2005), with estimates of less than 240 cm TL in the Mediterranean Sea (Tortonese 1956). Age at maturity and longevity are unknown. This shark is lecithotrophic viviparous, with both ovaries functional. It has moderate-sized litters of 7 to 25 young which vary according to the size of the female (Tortonese 1956, Bini 1967, CapapÃ© et al. 1990, Compagno et al. 2005). Records of size at birth are 20 to 30 cm TL (Tortonese 1956, Bini 1967, Compagno et al. 2005, Meyers et al. 2017). Gestation period is 8 to 10 months (CapapÃ© et al. 1990, Compagno et al. 2005), with young being born from December to February in the Mediterranean, April to July in the Canary Islands (Meyers et al. 2017), and July in the UK. A nursery area has been located and is being monitored at Las Teresitas in Tenerife, Canary Islands (EscÃ¡nez PÃ©rez et al. 2016). Aggregations of up to 15 individuals of this species have been recorded in the Canary Islands (E. Meyers unpubl. data 2017).Reproductive age and periodicity, rate of population increase, and natural mortality are unknown. The species' generation length is estimated at ~15 years, based on data for its relative the Pacific Angelshark (Squatina californica) (Cailliett et al. 1992).Â  ","The Great Torpedo Ray is demersal on the continental and insular shelves and slopes to depths of at least 925 m (Last et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of ~180 cm total length (TL) in the Atlantic Ocean (Last et al. 2016). In the South Pacific, males mature at ~60 cm TL (Last et al. 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous and litter size is up to 60 pups; nothing else is known of its biology.","The Marbled Torpedo Ray is demersal on the continental shelf and slope from nearshore to depths of at least 370 m (Last et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 100 cm total length (TL), but is not usually bigger than 60 cm TL (Last et al. 2016). Males mature at ~30 cm TL and females mature at ~40 cm TL (Last et al. 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous and size-at-birth is 10â14 cm TL (Last et al. 2016). Female age-at-maturity is 12 years and maximum age is 20 years, resulting in a generation length of 16 years (Mellinger 1971).","The Ocellate Torpedo is demersal on sandy and muddy substrates on the continental shelfÂ and slope from nearshoreÂ to a depth of 320 m (GulyuginÂ et al. 2006). It reaches a maximum size of 60 cm total length (TL), males mature at 18 cm TL and females mature at 22 cm TL(Abdel-Aziz 1994). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous, like other torpedo rays,Â with litter sizes of 3â21 pups and size-at-birth of 8â10 cm TL (Serena 2005). There is no information on this species' maximum age and age-at-maturity, hence, generation length was inferred based on data for the Marbled Torpedo (Torpedo marmorata). The Marbled Torpedo has an age-at-maturity of 12 years and a maximum age of 20 years and, thus, a generation length of 16 years (Mellinger 1971). The Ocellate Torpedo has a smaller maximum size than the Marbled Torpedo  (60 cm vs 100 cm TL), and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length was inferred to be 10 years for the Ocellate Torpedo.","The Velvet Dogfish has been recorded from the continental slope and oceanic ridges, and as epipelagic over deep water, from the surface to 1,511 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 109.4 cm total length (TL) (Pajuelo et al. 2010). Males mature at 47â51 cm TL and females mature at 59â69 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is likely aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 3â10 pups and size-at-birth is 20 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Nothing else is known of its biology.Â Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a related species, the Longnose Velvet Dogfish (Centroselachus crepidater) that has a female age-at-maturity of 20 years and a maximum age of 54 years, resulting in a generation length of 37 years (Irvine et al. 2006)."],"IUCN_geographicrange":["The Duckbill Eagle Ray is found in the Northeast Atlantic, Eastern Central Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea (but is absent from the Black Sea), Southeast Atlantic, and Western Indian Ocean (LastÂ et al.Â 2016).

Zidowitz unpubl. data 2021). The distributions of the two species in the âcommon skate complexâ are not precisely known, but available data indicate a large region of overlap from northern Scotland to the Celtic Sea, including west of Ireland (Griffiths et al. 2010, ICES 2012). Whilst initial studies of thermal preferences suggested Common Blue Skate may be the more southerly species of the âcommon skate complexâ (Griffiths et al. 2010), Common Blue Skate has been the member of the complex reported occurring in Icelandic waters (ICES 2012). Whilst âcommon skate complexâ has also been reported in the Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea, as far east as the Murman coast (Andriyashev 1954, Williams 2008), it is uncertain whether these records refer to Common Blue Skate and/or Flapper Skate, or another skate species (e.g., another Dipturus spp. or Bathyraja spp.). The southern distributional limits, including its presence off Spain and Portugal, are uncertain and, whilst reported originally from Iberian waters (e.g., Nobre 1935), it is usually the Long-nosed Skate (D. oxyrinchus) being the member of the genus more often reported there (Figueiredo et al. 2007). Whilst also previously being considered to occur in the western Mediterranean Sea and Adriatic Sea (Serena 2005), the historical occurrence of the species in that area is now uncertain (Serena et al. 2020), with recent studies (e.g., Cariani et al. 2017) only confirming the presence of the congeners Long-nosed Skate and Norwegian Skate (D. nidarosiensis).","The exact distribution of Flapper Skate in the Northeast Atlantic is uncertain, due to taxonomic confusion. It occurs from Scandinavia to the Celtic Sea, possibly extending as far north as Iceland, but the limits of the distribution beyond the central core are uncertain (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984; ICES 2012a,b; Ebert and Stehmann 2013; Last et al. 2016). The distributions of the two species in the âcommon skate complexâ are not precisely known, but available data indicate a large region of overlap from northern Scotland to the Celtic Sea, including west of Ireland (Griffiths et al. 2010, ICES 2012b). Whilst initial studies of thermal preferences suggested Flapper Skate may be the more northerly species of the âcommon skate complexâ (Griffiths et al. 2010), it has been Common Blue Skate that has been reported from Icelandic waters (ICES 2012a,b). Whilst âcommon skate complexâ has also been reported in the Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea, as far east as the Murman coast (Andriyashev 1954; Dolgov et al. 2005a,b; Williams 2008), it is uncertain whether these records refer to Flapper Skate and/or Common Blue Skate, or another skate species (e.g., another Dipturus spp. or Bathyraja spp.). Dolgov et al. (2005a,b) reported the âcommon skate complexâ in the western Barents Sea, and whilst these may relate to Flapper Skate, given that individuals >150 cm were reported, these skates may have been misidentified.","This species occurs in the Northeast Atlantic in the fjords of central and southern Norway, along the slopes off southern Iceland, western Scotland (including Rockall Trough) and west of Ireland as well as along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Iceland-Faroe Ridge.

It is absent from the Black Sea (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, Bauchot 1987, Notarbartolo di Sciara and Bianchi 1998, Relini et al. 2000, Ragonese et al. 2003, Sion et al. 2003, Serena 2005, Serena et al. 2011), and now considered absent from the Adriatic Sea (Ferretti et al. 2013). Its depth range is 50-800 m.","In the Northeast Atlantic this skate occurs in the offshore waters of the continental shelf from Madeira and northern Morocco. Northwards it is present but sparse in the Norwegian Sea including the Skagerrak, Icelandic waters, the Faroe Islands and east of Greenland (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, ICES 2012). It occurs in low numbers west of Scotland at Rockall Bank, in the Bay of Biscay region, in Iberian waters and around the Azores and mid-Atlantic ridge (ICES 2012). In the Mediterranean Sea it is known from the western and eastern central areas to Tunisia and western coasts of Greece, including the southern Adriatic Sea (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984, Bauchot 1987, Bertrand et al. 2000, Relini et al. 2000, Marano et al. 2003, Tinti et al. 2003, Serena et al. 2011).","From the Northeast and Eastern Central Atlantic, Cuckoo Skate (Leucoraja naevus) occurs off coasts northward from the Shetland Isles and southern Norway in the north, to Morocco in the south (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1989). It is common in the North Sea ecoregion, especially in the northwest area and occurs in low numbers around the Faroe Islands. It occurs throughout the Celtic Seas, including the Irish Sea, outer Bristol Channel, and outer western English Channel. In the Spanish survey of Porcupine Bank, west of Ireland, it is found mainly around the central mound of the bank (ICES 2013).   In the Mediterranean Sea this skate occurs in northern, western and central-eastern waters, excluding the Adriatic Sea. It has been recorded in waters off Algeria, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Morocco, Spain (including the Balaeric Islands) and Tunisia (Bauchot 1987, Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1989, Bertrand et al. 2000, Relini et al. 2000, Baino et al. 2001, Jukic-Peladic et al. 2001, Tinti et al. 2003, Serena et al. 2011, Valls et al. 2011). Its depth range is 20-500 m.","The Goblin Shark has a patchy yet widespread global distribution across the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans (Ebert et al. 2013). The Northwest Pacific (Japan and Taiwan) appears to be a hotspot of occurrence (DuffyÂ et al.Â 2004, YanoÂ et al.Â 2007). The species is likely to occur in more locations than presently known as surveys are undertaken in other regions or as deepwater fisheries expand globally.","The Spinetail Devil Ray is circumglobal in temperate and tropical waters throughout all oceans. Notably, it is present in the Mediterranean Sea but absent in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1987, Notarbartolo di Sciara et al. 2017) and its occurrence is patchy throughout its distribution (Lawson et al. 2017).","The Starry Smoothhound is found in theÂ Northeast and Eastern Central Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea (but absent from the Black Sea)Â from Scotland and southern Norway down to Western Sahara and the Canary IslandsÂ (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013).","The Common Smoothhound is found in the east Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea (but is absent from the Black Sea) (Serena 2005, Ebert and Stehmann 2013). It occurs from Portugal to the east coast of South Africa, including Madeira Island, the Canary Islands, the Cape Verde Archipelago, andÂ SÃ£o TomÃ©Â andÂ PrÃ­ncipeÂ (WirtzÂ et al.Â 2007,Â Ebert and Stehmann 2013, WirtzÂ et al.Â 2013). Records of this species in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (north of Portuguese waters, that is, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, France, and Spain) require confirmation and could be the result of misidentifications with the Starry Smoothhound (Mustelus asterias) (Farrell et al. 2009,Â McCully Phillips and Ellis 2015).","The Blackspotted Smoothhound occurs throughout coastal and continental shelf waters ofÂ the Mediterranean SeaÂ (but is absent from the Black Sea) with its range extending to the Eastern Central Atlantic (Western Sahara) (Serena 2005, Ebert et al. 2013).Â ","The Common Eagle Ray is found in the eastern Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea (but is absent from the Black Sea), and Western Indian Ocean (Serena 2005, Last et al. 2016). It occurs from the British Isles and the southern North Sea to South Africa, including Madeira Island and the Azores, and to Kenya in the Western Indian Ocean (Ebert and Stehmann 2013).","The Common Eagle Ray is found in the eastern Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea (but is absent from the Black Sea), and Western Indian Ocean (Serena 2005, Last et al. 2016). It occurs from the British Isles and the southern North Sea to South Africa, including Madeira Island and the Azores, and to Kenya in the Western Indian Ocean (Ebert and Stehmann 2013).","In the Northeast Atlantic, this skate is endemic to the continental slopes and adjacent banks along the Rockall Trough, west of Scotland and Ireland, and in the Bay of Biscay (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). Rodriguez-Cabello et al. (2013) reported a southward range expansion into deeper waters of the southern Bay of Biscay, off Galicia. Its depth range is 600â1,260 m.","The Smalltooth Sand Tiger is distributed worldwide, and is now reported from more than 30 countries, including numerous offshore and oceanic islands. Records for more than 160 captures and observations were collated and cited by Fergusson et al. (2008), and showedÂ theÂ Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ to haveÂ an seemingly disjunct distribution across most parts of the world. With additional and more recent records (e.g., AcuÃ±a-Marrero et al. 2013, Long et al. 2014), the presence of the Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ has now been establishedÂ around the peripheries of all oceans, and at some isolated mid-oceanic insular sites and on submarine ridges and seamounts; the species is also widespread throughout the Mediterranean Sea from where it was first described from France'sÂ CÃ´te d'AzurÂ by Risso (1810). Overall, the verified latitudinal rangeÂ is between 46Â°N in the Bay of Biscay to around 38â39Â°S in the Indian and Pacific Oceans; a more recent report of a dead Odontaspis (presumablyÂ the Smalltooth Sand Tiger), washed ashore on the coast of Normandy (western English Channel), possibly extends its northern range to almost 50Â°N (Ebert and Stehmann 2013).The following more detailed distributional information is mainly derived from Fergusson et al. (2008) which contains references to most published records; additional references are cited.Â In the eastern North Atlantic,Â the Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ has been recorded from the Bay of Biscay (France), Spain, Madeira, Azores, Canary Islands, Cape Verde Islands (Wirtz et al. 2013), Morocco, and Western Sahara; its shallow water occurrence at the Canary Islands is now featured on websites as a diver attraction. It is widespread in the Mediterranean Sea where records are from Spain and the Balearic Islands, Algeria, northern Tunisia, Italy, the Pelagic Islands, several countries bordering the Adriatic Sea, Greece and the Aegean Sea, Cyprus, Turkey, and Lebanon; it has also recently been included in the marine fauna of the adjacent coast of Israel (GalilÂ et al. 2011). Many of the Mediterranean sites apparently favoured byÂ the Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ are typically located either along the coasts of islands lying contiguous to deepwater, near offshore seamounts or at mainland localities where continental shelves are narrow, e.g., within the Tyrrhenian Sea, around Sicily, off southwestern Malta, off Lebanon, off the southern coast of Cyprus, and around the Dodecanese and Cyclades island groups of the Aegean Sea. It was first recorded off Lebanon by GeorgeÂ et al.Â (1964), but reports ofÂ the Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ being observed by divers near Beirut Â (FergussonÂ et al. 2008)Â are now believed to be misidentifications of of the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark (Hexanchus griseus).Â The status ofÂ the Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ in North African waters of the Mediterranean is patchily known. A small number of specimens are reported and confirmed by preserved dentition from Algerian fisheries and literature and contemporary records for Tunisia are equally sparse. However, specimens are likely still landed at Tunisian ports, from fisheries operating throughout the Sicilian Channel. There are no contemporary data for this species in Libyan or Egyptian waters but it may occur in the slope waters of the southern Levantine Basin.The species has been recorded from the western North Atlantic Ocean since 1989, with specimens being collected or observed from the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico), North Carolina (USA) and the Florida Straits; in 2004, a 3â4 m Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ was videoed in ~450 m depth on the Viosca Knoll, south of Alabama in the Gulf of Mexico (Sulak 2007). The presence ofÂ the Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ off Brazil was initially based on jaws collected by fishers off Natal, Rio Grande do Norte but there have been subsequent reports (with photographs) from shallow water around the Archipelago of Fernando de Noronha (Garla and Garcia 2006). In addition,Â LongÂ et al. (2014) cites reports of several longline captures by fishers operating from Santos City, SÃ£o Paulo State, southern Brazil. There is a one record from the eastern side of the South Atlantic: a specimen was caught in ~400 m during a 1969 trawl survey off the coast of Nigeria (Fishbase 2015).In the Indian Ocean off South Africa,Â theÂ Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ was first known from a few juvenile specimens recorded from trawls on the outer edges of the continental shelf off theÂ KwaZulu Natal coast. In the late 1980s, small numbers were caught on longline gear at about ~300 m along the south KwaZulu Natal coast, and further anecdotal information indicates relatively frequent capture of these sharks (of approx 2 m total length (TL)) during target fishing for deepsea sharks and rays (D. Ebert, pers. comm.).Â There have also been unconfirmed, but reliable, reports of sightings by divers of small aggregations ofÂ theÂ Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ around deepwater drop-offs on the Transkei coast in South Africa. To the north, captures have been made off Madagascar, the Chagos Archipelago (Winterbottom and Anderson 1997), the Maldives and Sri Lanka, while divers have observed the species in shallow water at Pemba Island (Tanzania). In the eastern Indian Ocean, divers photographed a large specimen in 15â30 m at Cocos-Keeling Island while, in Indonesia, the species has been observed among landed sharks from demersal longliners operating off southwestern Java and Lombok (White et al. 2006); there is also a single trawl capture from the Northwest Shelf off Western Australia. Captures in oceanic waters of the central and southern Indian Ocean have been over the Melville, South-West Indian, and Ninety-East Ridges.Across the North Pacific,Â theÂ Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ is known from Taiwan (Hsu et al. 2013), Japan, at the Kasuga-2 undersea volcano near the Mariana Archipelago (Juniper and Chadwick 2004), the Hawaiian Islands, southern California (USA) and the Gulf of California (Mexico); in 2010, divers reported the species in a kelp forest off southern California (see Elasmodiver 2015). In the eastern equatorial Pacific, the species is a dive attraction at Malpelo Island off Columbia, and the Isla del Cocos off Costa Rica while, in November 2010, a ~400 cm TL specimen was videotaped by divers at Wolf Island in the Galapagos Archipelago providing the first record for that locality (AcuÃ±a-Marrero et al. 2013, Ritter and Compagno 2013). In February 2013, its southern range in the eastern Pacific was extended by more than 3,000 km to central Chile when a specimen was photographed by a submersible in ~340 m at San Ambrosio Island, about 900 km west of the Chilean mainland (Long et al. 2014).Most South Pacific records are from western sector around Australia and New Zealand, and islands to their north. There are two records from deepwater research trawls south of New Caledonia and one from a commercial trawl in 883 m (the deepest record) on a seamount on the Louisville Ridge, 600 nautical miles east of New Zealand. There are several records from the east and west coasts of New Zealand's North Island, including a deep-baited video recording of aÂ Smalltooth Sand TigerÂ in 880 m off White Island in the Bay of Plenty (Te Papa 2009); the species is also a diver attraction at the Kermadec Islands to the north. Off southeastern Australia, almost 60 captures (mostly by trawl) are documented from outer-shelf and upper-slope depths (150â850 m) off New South Wales (NSW) and eastern Bass Strait. The only record from the south coast of Australia is aÂ neonate (102 cm TL) caught in 2005 by trawl in 240 m off South Australia (D. Bray, Museum Victoria, pers. comm.). In 2011â12, three large Smalltooth Sand TigersÂ were caught at the Barcoo and Taupo Seamounts (~200 nautical miles east of Newcastle, NSW) by power handline in depths between 400 and 600 m (Williams et al. 2013).Although the new records since the review by Fergusson et al. (2008), such as for the Galapagos Island, Chile and the south coast of Australia, add to the seemingly fragmented distribution of the Smalltooth Sand Tiger, they also give support to the contention by Long et al. (2014) that these apparently isolated records are, in reality, parts of a much broader and continuous distribution that will become better defined as more specimens are observed or collected.","The Angular Roughshark is found in the Northeast and Eastern Atlantic Ocean (from Norway to South Africa) and the Mediterranean Sea (absent from the Black Sea) (Ebert et al. 2013). Records from Mozambique require further verification (Ebert et al. 2013).","The Sailfin Roughshark is endemic to the Northeast and Eastern Central Atlantic, from Scotland to Senegal, and possibly southwards to the Gulf of Guinea (Ebert et al. 2013). The species has also been reported from the Mid-Atlantic RidgeÂ (Hareide and Garnes 2001).","The Blue Shark is one of the most wide-ranging of all sharks, found throughout all oceans in tropical and temperate waters (Last and Stevens 1994, EbertÂ et al.Â 2013).","In the Western Atlantic Ocean, Smalltooth Sawfish were widely distributed throughout tropical and subtropical marine and estuarine waters. Smalltooth Sawfish were found from Uruguay through the Caribbean and Central America, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic coast of the United States (Faria et al. 2013). However, Smalltooth Sawfish has been wholly or nearly extirpated from large areas of its former range. The species is currently known to occur in the southeastern United States (Simpfendorfer 2002), Bahamas (D. Grubbs pers. comm. 2012), Cuba, Honduras and Belize (R. Graham pers. comm. 2012).The current distribution of Smalltooth Sawfish in the Eastern Atlantic is uncertain due to species misidentification, lack of reporting, and the general contraction of its range. Smalltooth Sawfish was historically found along the coast of western Africa from Angola to Mauritania (Faria et al. 2013). There has been only one confirmed record for the region in the last 10 years (Sierra Leone in 2003). There are unconfirmed records (Pristis sp.) from only two other countries (Guinea-Bissau in 2011, and Mauritania 2010).The presence of sawfishes in the Mediterranean Sea is still uncertain (Whitehead et al. 1984, BilecenoÄlu and TaÅkavak 1999). Although Smalltooth Sawfish were included in historic faunal lists (Serena 2005), it is still debatable whether sawfishes occurred as part of the Mediterranean ichthyofauna or are a vagrant species as seasonal migrants from areas off western Africa. Reports of Smalltooth Sawfish outside of the Atlantic Ocean are likely misidentifications of other sawfish species (Faria et al. 2013). ","The Largetooth Sawfish (Pristis pristis) comprises four distinct subpopulations: Eastern Atlantic, Western Atlantic, Eastern Pacific and Indo-West Pacific.Eastern AtlanticThe current distribution of Largetooth Sawfish in the Eastern Atlantic is uncertain due to species identification issues, lack of reporting, and the general contraction of its range. Largetooth Sawfish were historically found along the coast of West Africa from Angola to Mauritania (Faria et al. 2013). Historic records indicate that Largetooth Sawfish were once relatively common in the coastal estuaries of West Africa. Verified records exist from Senegal (1841â1902), Gambia (1885â1909), Guinea-Bissau (1912), Republic of Guinea (1965), Sierra Leone (date unknown), Liberia (1927), CÃ´te dâIvoire (1881â1923), Congo (1951â1958), Democratic Republic of the Congo (1951â1959), and Angola (1951) (Burgess et al. 2009). Most records, however, lack data and locality and may have been confused taxonomically with other species. Unpublished notes from a 1950âs survey detail 12 Largetooth Sawfish from Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, CÃ´te dâIvoire, and Nigeria. The presence of sawfishes in the Mediterranean Sea is still uncertain (Whitehead et al. 1984, BilecenoÄlu and TaÅkavak 1999). There have been only two countries with confirmed records for the region in the last 10 years (Guinea-Bissau in 2003, 2004 and 2005; Sierra Leonne in 2003) and unconfirmed records (Pristis sp.) from one other country (Mauritania in 2010). It is likely that areas around Guinea-Bissau represent the last areas where sawfish can be found in West Africa (Mika Diop pers. comm. 2012).Although Largetooth Sawfish were included in historic faunal lists (Serena 2005), it is still debatable whether sawfishes occurred as part of the Mediterranean ichthyofauna or as a vagrant species as seasonal migrants from areas off West Africa.Western AtlanticIn the Western Atlantic, Largetooth Sawfish were widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical marine and estuarine waters. Largetooth Sawfish were found from Uruguay through the Caribbean and Central America, the Gulf of Mexico, and seasonally to the United States (Burgess et al. 2009, Faria et al. 2013). Currently, Largetooth Sawfish are thought to primarily occur in freshwater habitats in Central and South America. Largetooth Sawfish have been recorded in locations at least 1,340 km from the ocean in the Amazon River, as well as in Lake Nicaragua and the San Juan River and other east coast Nicaraguan rivers. The species has also been reported in coastal systems in Brazil, French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana and Columbia in South America. In Central America, scattered reports still exist for Largetooth Sawfish in Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Belize. In Mexico, the lack of records may indicate the species is no longer found west of the Yucatan Peninsula (R. Graham pers. comm. 2012). Throughout the Caribbean Sea, the species presence was historically uncertain and early records may have been Smalltooth Sawfish (P. pectinata). Though historically reported in the United States, it appears that Largetooth Sawfish were never abundant and was likely a season migrant. The species has not been reported in the United States since the 1960s (Burgess et al. 2009).Eastern PacificIn the Eastern Pacific, the historic range of Largetooth Sawfish was limited by the cooler water currents to the north of its range (California current) and the Humboldt Current in the south (V. Faria pers. comm. 2012). The historic range is thought to occur from MazatlÃ¡n, Mexico to Peru (Chirichigno and Cornejo 2001, Cook et al. 2005, Faria et al. 2013). Other references (i.e., Amezcua-Linares 2009) suggest that it occurred south from Topolobampo (some 440 km further north than MazatlÃ¡n), highlighting the uncertainty over its historic range. The occurrence of Largetooth Sawfish in Peru may have represented seasonal migration from the speciesâ core range in Central America. Largetooth Sawfish were historically reported from a number of freshwater systems in the Eastern Pacific (as summarised by Cook et al. 2005).Indo-West PacificThe Indo-West Pacific subpopulation of the Largetooth Sawfish was formerly wide-ranging from parts of the Western Indian Ocean through India, the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia to New Guinea and northern Australia. Its current distribution is now patchy across its range. It had been confirmed from several major river systems of Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Malaysia (including Borneo), Cambodia, Viet Nam and the Philippines (Roberts 1978, Tan and Lim 1998, Compagno et al. 2005, Stevens et al. 2005). Its occurrence in many of these is now uncertain or non-existent. It may now be extinct in several range states, including South Africa, the Seychelles, Thailand and others; elsewhere it has been severely depleted.Northern Australia may be the last viable population stronghold in the Indo-West Pacific, although it may persist in remote parts of the region. It occurs across tropical northern Australia from the northeastern coast of Queensland, across Cape York, the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Northern Territory and the Kimberley region (Western Australia). It has occurred as a vagrant to southwestern Australia (Last and Stevens 2009).","A wide-ranging species, the full extent of occurrence of the False CatsharkÂ is uncertain as records are sporadic. Records from the Southern Hemisphere are relatively scarce and the species most likely occurs at more locations than presently recorded (as evidenced by recent new records e.g. Friedlander et al. 2014, Brooks et al. 2015).  Northwest Atlantic (Canada, New York to New Jersey); Western Central Atlantic (The Bahamas); Northeast and Eastern Central Atlantic (Atlantic Slope off Iceland, France, Portugal, Madeira, Azores, Canary Islands, Senegal and Cape Verde Island); Western Indian Ocean (Aldabra Island group) and locations in the Southwest Indian (Alastair Graham, pers. comm., 2004); Northwest Pacific (Japan (southern Honshu and Okinawa) and Taiwan); Eastern Indian Ocean (Australia (Cape Leeuwin, Western Australia), eastern Indonesia); Western Central Pacific (Coral Sea, off Mackay, Queensland); Southwest Pacific (New Zealand (Three Kings Ridge and Hikurangi Trough, east of Mahia Peninsula), Pitcairn Islands); and Central Pacific (Hawaiian Islands) (Stewart and Clark 1988, Yano 1992, Yano and Musick 1992, Allen and Cowan 1995, Gilhen and Coad 1999, Stewart 2000, Baranes 2003, Kyne et al. 2005, King et al. 2006, Ebert et al. 2013, Friedlander et al. 2014, Brooks et al. 2015).","The Pelagic Stingray is circumglobal in all tropical and temperate oceans (Last et al. 2016).","Starry Skate (Raja asterias) can probably be considered endemic in the Mediterranean Sea, but may also occur in the Atlantic, near the southern coast of Portugal (Serena 2005). It has been reported for the northern and southern areas of the Balearic Islands of the western Mediterranean Sea (MassutÃ¬ and Moranta 2003), in the Tyrrhenian Sea of the northern Mediterranean (Romanelli et al. 2007), as well as along the Tunisian coasts (CapapÃ© 1977), and in the central Tyrrhenian Sea (Minervini et al. 1985).","Northeast and eastern central Atlantic: widely-distributed in shelf waters, from Madeira and Morocco in the south to the Shetland Isles in the north, including the Irish Sea, English Channel and south-western and north-western North Sea (Stehmann and Burkel 1984, Ellis et al. 2005a, ICES 2006).Mediterranean Sea: western Mediterranean Sea, including the waters of Spain, France, western Italy, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco (Bauchot 1987, Bertrand et al. 2000, Baino et al. 2001, Bertozzi et al. 2003). One doubtful record from the northern Aegean Sea (Serena 2005).","The Thornback Skate, or roker, is one of the most abundant rajids in north European coastal waters and can be the dominant rajid in commercial landings and research vessel catches (Rousset 1990a, Ellis unpubl.). It is widely distributed from Iceland and Norway (south of the Arctic Circle), to the North Sea (where it is now less abundant in south-eastern areas (Walker 1998), the Mediterranean, the western Black Sea, Madeira, the Atlantic coasts of Africa, and as far south as South Africa and the south-western Indian Ocean (Stehmann 1995). The status of this species in West and South African waters, and its relationship with Raja (Raja) cf. clavata, which is reported from the waters off Namibia and southern Africa (Macpherson 1986, Ebert et al. 1991, Smale and Cowley 1992) needs further research.","The Smalleyed Ray is restricted primarily to the Atlantic coasts of Northwest Europe, from the British Isles southwards to Gibraltar and northwestern Africa (Morocco and Western Sahara) (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1989) and is most abundant in bays and other inshore sandy areas.","The Brown Skate occurs in the Northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, and Eastern Central Atlantic, ranging from Spain (Bay of Biscay) through the Mediterranean Sea south to Morocco and Madeira (Portugal) (Last et al. 2016).","Widely distributed in the Northeast Atlantic, ranging from Morocco in the south to the Shetland Isles and Skagerrak and Kattegat in the north, including the Mediterranean Sea (Stehmann and Burkel 1984, Bauchot 1987). Within the Northeastern Atlantic it tends to occur in inshore waters and shallow shelf seas, in depths of 8 to 283 m (Ellis et al., 2005a), though it is most abundant in waters less than 100 m. Juveniles tend to occur closer inshore on sandy sediments, with adults also common further offshore on sand and coarse sand-gravel substrates.","Speckled Skate (Raja polystigma) is moderately common, endemic species throughout the Mediterranean Sea (Serena 2005), particularly in the western (Morocco, Spain and France) and western central areas (Tyrrhenia, Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily) (Baino et al. 2001, Ragonese et al. 2003, Florio et al. 2003, Follesa et al. 2003, Spedicato et al. 2003, Serena 2005, Mancusi et al. 2005), along northern African coasts (Stehmann and BÃ¼rkel 1984), and eastern Algerian coasts (Bertozzi et al. 2003). The species also exists in the southern Ligurian Sea (Vannucci et al. 2006) and around Asinara Island, northwest Sardinia (Catalano et al. 2007). It is rare in the Ionian Seas (Notarbartolo di Sciara and Bianchi 1998, Mytilineou et al. 2005). In the Adriatic Sea, it is rarely captured.","The Rough Skate occurs throughout the Mediterranean Sea, but mainly in the western region and around the Balearic Islands. It is absent from the Black Sea (Serena 2005). Reports from Portuguese waters and the northern coasts of Morocco suggest that this skate's range may extend into the eastern Atlantic, but these records require verification as they may be misidentifications of other Raja species. The Rough Skate is found at depths to approximately 350 m.","This species has a patchy distribution in the eastern Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea, with discrete areas where it may be locally common (southwestern Ireland, eastern English Channel, southern Portugal).Northeast and eastern central Atlantic: occurs from southern Ireland and southwestern England to the Gulf of Guinea, including the Canary Islands (Coelho and Erzini 2006).Mediterranean Sea: western Mediterranean, a few records along the coasts of Israel and Turkey (Serena 2005). It has been recorded in the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon on the south coast of Portugal (Coelho et al. 2002), an important nursery ground for many bony fishes (Erzini et al. 2002). Smaller specimens of R. undulata have been reported in this coastal lagoon which may suggest that this species also uses these sheltered areas as nursery grounds (Coelho et al. 2002).","Bigelowâs Skate is patchily distributed in the north and Eastern Central Atlantic from the Gulf of Mexico north to New England, USA, to the Scotian Shelf, Grand Banks and Labrador Shelf, Canada,Â to Greenland; in the Northeast Atlantic from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Rockall Trough and the Bay of Biscay (Spain); in the Eastern Central Atlantic Ocean from northern Morocco, Azores Islands, off Rio del Oro (Western Sahara) and Guinea Conakry (Moore et al. 2003, OrlovÂ et al. 2006, Ebert and Stehmann 2013, LastÂ et al.Â 2016).","Round Skate is distributed across the North Atlantic from northern USA and southern Nova Scotia (Canada) to the northern Bay of Biscay (France), including the Mid-Atlantic ridge (Ebert and Stehmann 2013, LastÂ et al. 2016, ICES WGFE 2018).","Mid-Atlantic Skate (Rajella kukujevi) is endemic to the Northeast Atlantic.

Records from northwest Africa were likely confused with the West African Catshark (Scyliorhinus cervigoni) (Soares and de Carvalho 2019).","The Knifetooth Dogfish is known from the Northeast and Central Atlantic (Scotland to Senegal) and the Southwest Pacific Oceans (New Zealand) (Ebert et al. 2013).","The Greenland Shark is found in theÂ North Atlantic from the USA and Canada to Greenland in the west and from Portugal to the Barents Sea and Eastern Siberian Sea (Moreno and Pol 1992, MacNeil et al. 2012, Ebert et al. 2013, A.M. Orlov pers. comm. 25/08/2020). Genetic analyses caution that the geographic range of this species may be much narrower, ranging from Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Faroe Islands, and Norway, with occasional records from Cuba, France and Spain (Canary Is.) (Yano et al. 2007, MacNeil et al. 2012, WalterÂ et al. 2017, Simpson et al. 2018). Records from the western Atlantic, including records from the northern Gulf of Mexico and Canadian side off the Davis Strait exhibit evidence of introgressive hybridisation with Pacific Sleeper Shark (Somniosus pacificus) which has been recorded as far north as the Azores Islands (Portugal) (WalterÂ et al.Â 2017).","The Little Sleeper Shark is known from a patchy distribution in the Northeast and Western Central Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea (Ebert et al. 2013).","The Scalloped Hammerhead has a circumglobal distribution in coastal warm-temperate and tropical seas (Ebert et al 2013).","The Great Hammerhead ranges worldwide throughout tropical and warm temperate seas (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013).","The Smooth Hammerhead occurs worldwide in temperate seas and in some regions, it is present in tropical seas (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013, Bezerra et al. 2018).","The Spined Pygmy Shark has a widespread, yet patchy, global distribution in the Atlantic, and Indo-Pacific Oceans (Last and Stevens 2009, EbertÂ et al.Â 2013).Â ","The Spiny Dogfish has a global distribution, present in boreal and temperate waters in theÂ Northeast and Northwest Atlantic, including the Mediterranean and Black Seas, the Southeast Pacific and Southwest Atlantic off South America, the Southeast Atlantic off South Africa, and the Southwest Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans off Australia and New ZealandÂ (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013).Â ","The Longnose Spurdog is known from the eastern Atlantic Ocean (from France to South Africa) and Mediterranean Sea, including the Black Sea (VerÃ­ssimo et al. 2017, de Viana et al. 2018).","The Sawback Angelshark occurs along the southern Mediterranean coast from Algeria to the eastern basin, and along the northern coast from Turkey possibly to Albania. It is confirmed as extant in Tunisia, Sicily, Israel, northern Cyprus, Turkey, the Aegean Islands, and eastern mainland Greece. Its presence is uncertain in Algeria, Sardinia, Malta, Libya, Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, southern Cyprus, Crete, western mainland Greece, and Albania (E. Meyers unpubl. data 2019). In the Eastern Atlantic, it is extant in Senegal, The Gambia, and Sierra Leone. Its presence is uncertain in Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and Liberia (E. Meyers unpubl. data 2019). ","                      Historically, the Smoothback Angelshark occurred in the Mediterranean from France and Tunisia to the eastern basin and the Sea of Marmara. In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, this species occurred from Mauritania to Senegal. The species has not been reported from many areas in the region over the past several decades, and may now be absent from some areas that have been subject to heavy fishing pressure.","The Angelshark originally ranged from Scandinavia to Northwestern Africa (Morocco and the Canary Islands), including the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Current distribution appears to be reduced from this historic range, as a result of severe population depletion resulting in range contraction and localized extinctions; for example, it is now considered to be locally extinct in the North Sea (ICES 2005, although there is a museum record from Denmark in 2002 â Zidowitz unpubl. data 2016) and is no longer encountered in some areas of the northern Mediterranean. However, reports of Angelshark individuals from the Celtic Seas ecoregion (ICES 2016, Natural Resources Wales data, Shark Trust data, Fitzmaurice et al. 2003,  WÃ¶gerbauer et al. 2014), Tyrrhenian Sea (Giusto and Ragonese 2014, Cavallaro et al. 2015), North Adriatic Sea (Fortibuoni et al. 2016), Aegean Sea (Kabasakal and Kabasakal 2004, Ogretmen 2005, Ismen et al. 2009, Karakulak et al. 2006), the Sea of Marmara (Kabasakal and Kabasakal 2014), and Mediterranean coasts of Turkey (Akyol et al. 2015, Yaglioglu et al. 2015), and Algeria (Ramdane and Trilles 2008) demonstrate that the species is still extant in these areas. In addition, it is still sighted regularly around the Canary Island archipelago (Meyers et al. 2017).Â ","The Great Torpedo Ray has a widespread, yet patchy, distribution in the Eastern Atlantic (from Denmark to South Africa) and Indo-Pacific (Australia and New Zealand) and in the Mediterranean Sea (Last et al. 2016).","The Marbled Torpedo Ray is found in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean (northern Europe to South Africa) and the Mediterranean Sea (Last et al. 2016).","The Ocellate Torpedo is found in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea (although absent from the Black Sea) and occurs from the southern Bay of Biscay to Angola (Last et al. 2016). It has not been recorded from the Cape Verde Archipelago but is found around SÃ£o TomÃ©Â andÂ PrÃ­ncipeÂ (Afonso et al. 1999, Wirtz et al. 2013).","The Velvet Dogfish has a widespread, yet patchy, global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans (EbertÂ et al.Â 2013)."]},"columns":[{"accessor":"Species","name":"Species","type":"character","minWidth":200,"sticky":"left","style":{"borderRight":"1px solid #eee","backgroundColor":"#f9e79f"},"headerStyle":{"borderRight":"1px solid #eee"}},{"accessor":"Name_FR","name":"Name_FR","type":"character"},{"accessor":"Beukhof_Habitat","name":"Beukhof_Habitat","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FishMed_Habitat","name":"FishMed_Habitat","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FB_Habitat","name":"FB_Habitat","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FishMed_Min_depth","name":"FishMed_Min_depth","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FishMed_Max_depth","name":"FishMed_Max_depth","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FB_Min_depth","name":"FB_Min_depth","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FB_Max_depth","name":"FB_Max_depth","type":"character"},{"accessor":"Beukhof_Max_length","name":"Beukhof_Max_length","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FishMed_Common_length","name":"FishMed_Common_length","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FishMed_Max_length","name":"FishMed_Max_length","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FB_Max_length","name":"FB_Max_length","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FB_Common_length","name":"FB_Common_length","type":"character"},{"accessor":"Beukhof_Reproduction","name":"Beukhof_Reproduction","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FishMed_Reproduction","name":"FishMed_Reproduction","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FB_Reproduction","name":"FB_Reproduction","type":"character"},{"accessor":"Beukhof_Fecundity","name":"Beukhof_Fecundity","type":"character"},{"accessor":"Beukhof_Trophic_level","name":"Beukhof_Trophic_level","type":"character"},{"accessor":"Beukhof_Diet","name":"Beukhof_Diet","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FishMed_Diet","name":"FishMed_Diet","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FishMed_Trophic_level","name":"FishMed_Trophic_level","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FB_Trophic_level","name":"FB_Trophic_level","type":"character"},{"accessor":"FB_description","name":"FB_description","type":"character","minWidth":800},{"accessor":"FB_Life_cycle","name":"FB_Life_cycle","type":"character","minWidth":800},{"accessor":"IUCN_rationale","name":"IUCN_rationale","type":"character","minWidth":800},{"accessor":"IUCN_habitat","name":"IUCN_habitat","type":"character","minWidth":800},{"accessor":"IUCN_geographicrange","name":"IUCN_geographicrange","type":"character","minWidth":800}],"resizable":true,"filterable":true,"searchable":true,"defaultPageSize":2,"showPageSizeOptions":true,"pageSizeOptions":[10,25,50,100],"paginationType":"numbers","showPageInfo":true,"minRows":1,"highlight":true,"striped":true,"dataKey":"70bb6d81ce55b774f4732f8ad44d5f95"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
